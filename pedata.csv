3/12/14 10:50,3/12/14 12:04,101,0,0,0,0,0,0,1) In senior year we had our Honors Convocation for students who obtained a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher. Most of my friends obtained the gold or purple cord; which signified a GPA of 3.75 or above. When my best friend went on stage; he received the white cord; which is for a GPA of 3-3.25. All of us were astonished; not because we thought any lower of him; but for the entire 4 years my friend told us that his grades were right up there with ours and because we took very similar classes. Nobody really questioned anything because we assumed he was telling the truth. The next day I went to his house because I wanted answers. He was hard to talk to at first because he figured out that something was wrong but he did not want to tell me. It was a struggle for him to even look me in the eye because he knew he'd been lying to everybody; including me; for the better part of 4 years. After some not-so-friendly talking; he spilled. He broke into tears and revealed to me that he has a learning disability; and didn't want to disclose anything to his close friends because he thought we would look down upon him.  /  / 2) I just felt terrible and wanted him to get better. I pitied him because he didn't know what to say to us.  /  / 3) I wanted him to tell the rest of our friends and come clean. That's the only way to get over a situation like this. ,,1) When my father went out of the country for a business trip; my mom was home alone for about 2 weeks. We have a lot of family nearby but she was home taking care of my grandmother who fell ill just a week before. It was difficult to see both of them stuck at home; and my mom running around to do everything she could to help my grandmother. I could see the pain and struggle in her eyes as it was difficult for her to manage the house with an ill grandmother and two teenage kids running around; wanting to have their freedom.  /  / 2) I wanted to help her by spending more quality time with her. It's so easy to disregard spending time with parents when we get busy with our own lives. But a little deeper look at the situation shows that our parents tend to be more busy than us; just in different ways.  /  / 3) I told her I'd take her out to dinner once so she can get her mind off how stressful everything was and I got her a massage pass at the nearest spa so she can get some actual relaxation. It made everything feel so much better that I was closer to her than ever before. ,1) During this school  year a friend I met earlier decided to transfer to a different school. He was an out of state student and just couldn't adjust to this university. I talked to him soon after he decided to transfer and he told me that it just wouldn't work. For one; he's an out of state student who didn't know anybody upon coming to this school. As that kind of student; you really hope for a good room mate who you can be with for the early parts of the year. His roommate was terrible. An arrogant student who didn't care at all for anybody else.  /  / 2) I wanted to help him and do something that would make him feel more at home. Even though I've never been through a situation exactly like that; I've heard stories and could only imagine what that would be like.  /  / 3) I spent more time with him; hoping that he would change his mind. I also invited more of my friends to hangout with him so he feels a sense of comfort. Unfortunately; he still decided to transfer as the large classes and the overall community wasn't something that liked too much. ,"1) A close friend of mine didn't get into her dream Ivy League school this past year. Personally; I never thought too deeply of going to a school like that until right around the college application process. I fell in love with some of the schools there and worked endlessly to complete applications and recommendation letters. I too got rejected from my dream school and allowed me to empathize.  /  / 2) When she told me; I felt like I knew exactly what she was feeling as I was there just a year ago. It's a horrible feeling; a feeling that all of your hard work in the past 12 years gets reduced to a few sheets of papers; that either gets an ""Accept"" or ""Rejection"". It's demoralizing; really. And I knew she felt the same.  /  / 3) So I called her and told her to keep her head up and realize that the school doesn't make the person; but the person and that school can make a difference. And that just because one school doesn't necessarily want her; it doesn't mean she's not good enough to get things done. Obviously these are just words that will only have a meaning later on; but just having somebody to talk to really does make a difference in a time like that.  / ",1,3,0,1,0,2,,,1,,,1,1,6,1,4,3,5,1,5,7,5,3,1,1,1,5,2,1,1,1,5,3,3,5,6,6,6,5,2,5,5,4,1. Sympathy / 2. Sadness / 3. Relief,I believe that would be a false notion of love. Love is an emotion that should be expressed through times of hardship and happiness; and every single emotion that exists. Love is a complementary emotion that is felt between two people; or things; and is one that is omnipresent. Saying that pity is a kind love may be one way to portray what love is; but love cannot be the only emotion shown during times of pity. Pity means you feel poorly for somebody and wish the best for them. If love was present in this; then that feeling would change to a feeling of making yourself to anything possible to make whom you love feel better. ,I believe this is relatively true. Contempt may be a more harsh way to phrase things; but there must be some pity present for one to feel contempt. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,1,5,1,4,4,5,1,3,2,4,3,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,3,4,6,7,5,4,3,3,4,4,4,4,1. Love / 2. Happiness / 3. Sympathy,Compassion and love do come hand in hand. I believe that one can only feel true compassion with somebody else if there is love between the two. Compassion is having the ability to pick out what's wrong without somebody having to say it; and doing something that makes it easier for that person to have a normal sense back. It's difficult to judge where the line is; but I believe that compassion can only exist where love is present; not necessarily a kind of love. They coexist. ,2,1,6,1,4,4,3,1,4,3,2,1,1,4,1,2,3,4,3,3,4,5,4,3,3,3,5,4,4,3,2,3,1. Pity / 2. Caring / 3. ,"I believe that sympathy is definitely something that exists during love but is not necessarily an indicator of love. I did not ""love"" my friend as I would see others but I still sympathized with him because of his situation. ",1,1,7,1,5,2,5,1,1,5,6,2,1,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,3,3,2,5,5,4,5,2,2,2,3,3,1. Sadness / 2.  / 3. ,Empathy isn't necessarily a kind of love; but it's something that will truly exist if the time comes when two people care about each other a lot. I by no means loved that person; but I did care very deeply for them as a close friend would. I say this because I would go out of my way to help; but I wouldn't feel the need to do so as I would for others that I do believe I love. Therefore; I believe that empathy is an emotion that is present in love; but love is not needed to empathize. 
3/12/14 12:55,3/12/14 13:48,102,0,0,0,0,0,0,When I was in 8th grade; my younger brother was at the same school as me and was in the 6th grade.  My brother had always been the opposite of me in that he never wanted to do is homework and most times; never did his homework.  One time he had lied to our parents about homework so much that he had 20 missing assignments.  This number was unheard of.  Growing up in the same environment as him; I felt very little sympathy for him because I had taken the same classes and done just fine.  In addition; he was showing no effort to succeed.  However; one day at my brother's flag football game; some kid told his parent that someone had 20 missing assignments and then the surrounding parents started ridiculing the kid and the parent; even though my mom was sitting right there.  Then the parent asked who the kid was and when he said the name; all the parents got super quiet because they knew that they had been ridiculing my mom and her son right in front of her face.  When my mom came home and told me the story; I felt pity for my brother.  Not in the way that I felt bad for him having the missing assignments; but because I felt bad that people were talking about him behind his back.  They had not known the circumstances and they were not justified to talk about him like that.  However; since I felt my brother should have never been in the situation; I did not feel stronger emotions; such as sympathy or compassion.,This last summer; my girlfriend's two best friends' moms both got diagnosed with cancer at roughly the same time.  It was a terrible situation; although both were told that the cancers should not be terminal.  However; when she told me this; I felt tenderness toward her.  She had grown up with these best friends and therefore; knew each of the moms on a relatively personal level.  However; it was nothing like having one of her own parents diagnosed with cancer so it was a difficult spot to feel sympathy for.  It was noticeable that she was upset; but then again she wasn't completely shaken up.  Therefore; I felt some caring attitude toward her; but it was not overwhelming. ,,"This year at the NCRB; I was playing basketball but was waiting on the sideline to play in the next game.  In the game; there was one player who was not good at all.  He was also cherry picking; or not playing much defense and just running to the other end of the court when his team got the ball.  One play; he was all the way down on the offense side of the court when his team got the ball and they threw it down the court to him.  Therefore; he had a wide open layup.  He missed the layup 3 times and then that is when someone on the other team ran down the court to get a rebound (since everyone assumed he would make it).  He then missed a layup for the 4th time in a row and the other team got the ball.  When they came back down the court; all the older; better basketball players were making fun of him very badly.  All of a sudden; he stormed off the court with what looked like tears in his eyes.  He was saying ""Fuck Off"" to them; but looked more sad than mad at the situation.  He grabbed his things and left.  He obviously should have made the layups and I would consider myself way better at basketball than him; but I did not say anything and felt that no one else should have; unless maybe you were friends with him.  ",Earlier this year; one of my friends was arguing with his girlfriend and was not in a good mood.  He was in his room and had to ask his roommate to leave so he could talk.  They were talking about him; not in a negative way; but also not in a positive way.  I felt that they shouldn't really tell everyone about it because it was his personal business.  I felt empathy toward him because I have had fights with my girlfriend and I know that I usually would rather have no one know because it makes the situation simpler and easier to resolve.  Therefore; I felt as if I had been in that situation before and knew exactly how he was feeling; despite not knowing what the fight was about.,1,0,1,3,2,1,,1,,,,1,1,7,1,5,3,2,1,1,7,6,4,4,3,2,6,5,6,2,6,7,5,3,4,2,2,6,6,1,1,2,4,1. Sadness / 2. Anger / 3.

3/12/14 12:56,3/12/14 13:49,103,0,0,0,0,0,0,When my friend got into an advanced school for science and math; I pitied her because I knew the amount of time and work that would have be put into it. She stayed up late almost every night either studying or finishing homework. It was helpful and challenging; but in the end we both ended up going to the same college. I think she would have had a better high school experience if she had not gone to that program.,When I was visiting my grandpa in the hospital; I knew it would be the last time I would see him. He was attached to many different machines and on various medicines. By the time I had gotten to the hospital in New Jersey; he was unconscious the entire time. I knew he did not know I was there with him; but I was glad to be there with my entire family. The waiting room for the ICU patients was entirely taken up by our family and friends. That is when I truly realized the great impact my grandpa had on so many people's lives. When I went by his side; I held his hand as the machines were unplugged; honored to have called such a great man my grandfather. Just his touch was so tender and comforting. ,When I travel to places like India; there are people there living on the streets with no money; home; and minimal clothes. I feel compassion for them. If I were in their shoes; I imagine what it would be like. I realize how fortunate I am to have as much as I do and also realize how much I take for granted. I try to help by giving them some money; even though it is not enough to greatly impact their lives; hopefully it can improve their lives even a little. It is hard to imagine so many lives in poverty when we are blessed with so much; but it is present in places all around the world. I feel compassion for all these brave and strong people who experience it every day. ,When my sister had to get stitches in her head; I stayed at home with my uncle while my parents took her to the doctor. I felt bad that this had happened to her and wanted to help. Although I did not know how she felt and could not know how she felt; I felt sympathy for her. I wanted to help and make her feel better in any way possible. I would watch TV and play games with her. I knew the things she was missing out on. We went on vacation shortly after; and she could not go in the ocean because of her injury so I stayed and made sandcastles with her so she would not feel left out. ,,1,0,1,1,2,3,,,,1,,1,1,6,1,2,5,4,1,2,4,2,3,1,4,3,2,5,4,5,3,5,5,4,4,3,4,5,,2,4,2,4,1. sad / 2. love / 3. helpful ,Pity is wanting the best for someone who you love.

3/12/14 12:58,3/12/14 13:38,104,0,0,0,0,0,0,A time that i felt pity toward someone was in my high school diving state meet.  I had trained hard all season and then got into a bad car accident that didn't allow me to practice.  So i got back on the boards just in time to be able to qualify and compete for states.  My dream the last 4 years of high school was to win the state meet my senior year.  My two big competitors we really talented diver but nothing too hard for me to handle.  So during the whole competition i felt pity toward them because i kept telling myself that i messed up because of my time away.  It wasn't fair for me to do that but i did.  I ended up getting 3rd in the state whicjh i was happy with but I know that if i hadnt been injured i could have won.  So after the competition and even now i feel pity towadr those girls.  ,,When i feel compassionate toward someone I know I love them.  I am compassionate toward my boyfriend as he is toward me.  A moment when I feel this way is when he took me out to dinner on valentines day.  It was the perfect moment and I know I couldn't be happier with anyone else.  He cares about me and he loves me and that makes me feel compassion for him.   ,,One time I experienced the feeling of empathy was when I was younger.  My aunt was going through breast cancer and that made me feel very empathetic toward her situation.  It also made me feel that way about the rest of our family and for her kids and her husband.  What they had to go through was hard on the family and i felt very empathetic for them.  It was hard for my dad too because it was his sister and it was scary having to watch him go through that with her.  I would hear stories from my dad and from my cousins about the surgeries and medicine she has to take.  When she went through therapy and started to lose her hair i again felt empathetic.  I could have never imagined having to go through something like that in my life and feeling sorry for my family that they had to deal with me.  As a kind an observer i felt empathetic for her and having breast cancer.     ,1,3,0,1,0,0,,,1,,1,1,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,2,4,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,1,1,1,7,7,2,7,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1. jealousy  / 2.  / 3. ,I think pity can be connected with jealousy not love.   ,I agree ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,1,7,1,7,1,1,1,1,7,7,1,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,7,7,1. love  / 2. caring  / 3. ,Compassion is a caring kind of love.

I felt bad for her because she had worked so hard throughout high school and now she was not able to play in her last season of high school because she was injured. I felt pity because I thought she deserved better. I wanted to help her but there was only so much I could do. I tried to make her happy by distracting her attention off of soccer and spend time with her doing different activities. ,,I once felt compassion toward my best friend. I remember a moment where I was going through a difficult time in my life and she was there to support me and make me feel better. I really appreciated her efforts in trying to make me feel better. It made me want to be able to do the same for her. If she was ever in a difficult time in her life I would hope that I could also be the person she can rely on talking to and trusting. I felt like our relationship grew after I had shared things that I would not have been able to with others and this built my compassion towards them.,,The last time I felt empathy toward someone was when my dad got promoted in his job. He was not doing to well financially and it caused our whole family to feel worried and stressed . But once he found out this great news all of the stress was put away.

3/12/14 13:55,3/12/14 14:44,106,0,0,0,0,0,0,The last time that I felt pity towards someone was when I was home over spring break. Walking down the blocks in New York City I saw so many homeless men and women; but instead of feeling badly for them and trying to help them out; I felt puty towards them. There signs read things about just using the money for alcohol; or they are sitting in the cold; smoking cigarettes while the dog they have kept with them looks as though it has not eaten in the longest time. This was pity; because I felt bad for their poor judgement in the truly awful situations that they were in. ,,"One time in which I have felt compassion towards someone was when I did Dance Marathon at the University of Michigan just a couple of weeks ago. For Dance Marathon we are supposed to stand for 30 hours; dancing for most of it; in order to show our support and understanding for the children who go through a similar pain but a completely different struggle each day with their illness. Each team is given a family that they get to interact with and hear their stories and see their struggles. However; I did not feel immediately emphatic towards our girl; Emma; who did not speak until the age of 5 because of down syndrome. I did not immediately feel pity towards her family for dealing with a child with a disability. Instead I felt compassion for our sporty and spunky Emma; who never complained once or even spoke about what was ""wrong"" with her. Instead she came into the room; smiling; ready to play basketball; her second favorite sport. She introduced herself to all of us; organized a photo to her liking; and never stopped playing basketball with all of us. Her family just looked happy to see their daughter interacting and having fun. This was the last time I truly felt compassionate towards a girl and her family. ",One time in which I felt sympathy towards someone was when my roommate was going through a hard time with her boyfriend; and I was able to relate and feel the struggle and emotions she was going through.

I invested a great deal of time and energy in hating them and feeling negatively about them; but after a long time (and my mom telling me for years and years that it wasn't my problem) there was one boy in particular who I came to pity over hating. His name was Jared and he'd treated me like crap from 3rd or 4th grade all the way through 8th grade and even into high school. He teased me; called me names in front of other kids; pushed me around on the playground; and started rumors about me. But somewhere near the end of my 8th grade year and into the first year of high school; I came to understand that his family situation was somewhat unpleasant and that his mother was a very aggressive; unforgiving; unkind person who probably took out a lot of that on him. I came to pity him because he was obviously not in a very good place and did not have the kind of support systems I did; meaning that he already had a great deal of unpleasant stuff to deal with just like me but without the benefit of having someone there to pick up the pieces. Additionally; he would probably struggle with having meaningful relationships for a long time if not the rest of his life because it was clear that the only way he knew how to deal with his negative emotions was by taking that out on other people in hurtful ways. My pity for him was not pleasant or kind.,,Recently; my friend Gretta was telling me about how her parents tend to treat her concerns about social issues with a great deal of dismissal in favor of their own agenda. When she tried to bring up the topic of violence against women in conversation over dinner; they changed the topic and belittled her concerns; comparing an unwillingness to recycle with violent crimes that had affected people that Gretta and I both know. I felt compassion for her because I understand what it's like to have family trivialize your concerns and I find it unfair that these people she is meant to trust most won't give her the same trust in return. Her situation made me feel like I needed to reach out to her and show her that; even if her parents weren't listening; I was and I understood both her concern and her frustration and disappointment. I told her that I knew the feeling of dismissal and that it was unfair of her parents to treat her and her concerns in such a way; but that it's important not to lose hope and continue to try and make others understand.,My friend Holly's parents were divorced a few years ago and the breakup was really hard on her. I am also a child of divorced parents; but my mom and dad split when I was still a baby and I have lived significantly far from my dad from the age of four onwards. I could reach out and try to understand Holly's feelings using the knowledge I already had of how hard it was to feel like you had to pick sides; but I couldn't put myself entirely in her shoes because I did not know what a breakup felt like firsthand. I tried to make sure that she understood I was there for her as much as she needed me to be and that I could talk to her as much as she wanted.,"One of my closer friends; Sarah; went to a Catholic school for a number of years; like me. Neither of us are still Catholic; but we retain strong ties to some members of our former churches and both have fond memories of the schools we attended; grateful even for the religious education they gave us. Recently; she told me that some changes made by the diocese that oversees her old school would cost some of her favorite teachers their jobs on the grounds of ideology. The regulation stipulated that the school would no longer employ anyone who vocally supported or engaged in ""lifestyles"" contradictory to the teachings/beliefs of the Church; including support for being homosexual. Both she and I are non-heterosexual; so this struck a chord with both of us and I felt empathy for her; understanding her feelings of betrayal and fear that an environment which could have been so enriching and positive for us even in the face of doctrine could make such exclusionary and harmful decisions. At the time it reminded me of when my own former school made some similar changes; laying off some of our best teachers on the grounds of their religion (prior to this; it had been common to have Protestant teachers; but the new Bishop didn't agree). I told Sarah that I understood how unfair and frightening something like that could be and that I would be there to listen and talk about it as much as she needed.",1,3,0,1,0,2,,,1,,,2,2,2,1,2,3,1,1,5,1,2,2,4,5,3,5,1,1,5,5,2,2,3,5,1,1,3,2,3,3,1,2,1.

3/12/14 13:56,3/12/14 14:47,108,0,0,0,0,0,0,One time; a friend and I were going to the movies together. I do not have a car; so he was driving us. On the way there; we hit an enormous pothole that literally destroyed both of the tires on the right side of his car. We pulled into a nearby parking lot and we could hear and see all of the air pouring out of the tires. He was swearing a lot. He tried to call AAA; which; ironically; his father works for; but they said that his card was inactive. We eventually found someone who used their information to call them for us and have a tow truck sent to get us. We had to wait for the tow truck for several hours; since so many other people had hit the pothole at the same time and also had to call AAA. As he was finally getting into the truck to be taken to the tire store; his pants ripped. Not to mention he was very worried about getting his car fixed on time; because he had to drive to court the next day because he got caught drinking underage. I didn't know what to say except that I was sorry. I didn't know how to help; but I felt a lot of pity for my friend because that was so many lousy things to have happen at once. I also felt kind of sorry for myself; though; because I really wanted to see the movie. And I felt very angry at AAA because they knew we were stranded but refused to help us out without a valid card; I know it is business; but it was still frustrating. ,I have a friend who has consistently struggled with emotional instability issues. We met recently; but had no trouble becoming close with each other because I have also struggled with similar issues throughout my life. There was one evening when I was over at his apartment and he and his roommates had some guests over who were drinking and being very loud. I could tell from the moment I came over that he was in a lousy mood; but when the guests started drinking I could see that he was struggling with handling his emotions and keeping his composure in the situation. Although my attempts felt worthless; I tried my best to convey tenderness; patience; and understanding to him so that he; if nothing else; would not feel any worse that evening. I did not feel as though I could truly help him feel better; but again; the tenderness I attempted to communicate to him was in an effort to not let his mood get any worse. ,When I first met my boyfriend; we obviously took a lot of time to get to know each other. I came from a very broken and disruptive family. His experiences were by no means identical to mine; but I feel very compassionate toward him when he told me about his older brother being out of the house and feeling like he had no one to turn to when his parents were fighting. I also have a significantly older brother; and although his parents worked through the issues they were going through and mine did not; I definitely felt compassionate because I know first hand that witnessing people that you care about fight is something that can be really emotionally painful. I really just told him; then; about my personal experiences and told him specifically about my own experiences that were kind of similar. ,My mother has been going through a very difficult time lately. She is battling numerous health issues and is trying her hardest; but is unfortunately mostly unsuccessful; to find medical care professionals to help her through at least some of these issues; some of which have been plaguing her for years; some of which are more recent. She has been travelling a lot; in great pain; trying to find doctors to help with disappointing results. Unfortunately; on top of all of this happening; last month her mother died. She and her little sister are the only surviving members of their six-person immediate family; so my mother had to fly out to her hometown and clean out her mother's apartment and decide what to keep; store; and get rid of. I saw her for a few days over my spring break; and I felt an extreme; but also kind of hopeless and helpless sympathy for her. I felt so; so sad for everything that she was going through and wanted so badly to be there for her and help her through things. I believe that she realized that I was available to be her support system; but I think that the issues are that her problems are so much more than anything I could truly help her with. I think she appreciated my sympathy; but did not know what to do with it. ,,1,3,0,0,1,2,,,,1,,1,1,7,1,6,2,1,1,5,3,6,3,1,1,1,5,2,2,2,3,6,4,6,6,2,2,4,4,6,3,1,6,1. Anger / 2. Impatience / 3.

3/12/14 13:58,3/12/14 14:49,109,0,0,0,0,0,0,,I felt tenderness for my best friend; when she lost her father to cancer. She was very close to her father; and I knew this was a sad time for her. I felt like I had to be careful about what i said; or did. I didn't want to set her off into a frenzy of cries. I had to make sure to keep in mind of her emotions; and feelings; and be there for her any way she needed. I wanted to be a good friend; and look out for her.  ,I felt compassion for my ex-boyfriend when his mom moved backed to Michigan. During this time my ex and I were really close ; and He told me multiple times how much he missed his mom; and wanted her to move back to Michigan. They had a really close relationship; so when she moved back; i felt happy and compassionate for him. ,A time when I felt sympathy for someone; was my cousin; when you she was going through a hard time. My cousin did not grow up in the most stable environment. When I say she didn't grow up in a stable environment; I mean she watched as her mom got beat by her boyfriend; and watched as he put his whole other family in the same; small two bedroom apartment. She watched her mom be mistreated and used; and as an effect of that; her and her mom did not have a close relationship. Well recently my cousin got into an abusive relationship; and she doesn't know how to deal with it; because she is just doing what she saw; and I feel sympathy for her not knowing any better.  ,I felt empathy when a friend of mine broke her ankle. I felt empathy for her; because I watched it happen. I told her not to jump off the bench but she did it anyway and broke her ankle.  i felt empathy for her because; I know it had to hurt; but I couldn't see myself in the same situation. ,1,0,1,0,2,3,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,7,1,1,7,1,1,7,7,7,5,1,1,1,4,1,1,1,1,7,2,7,6,1,3,1,1,1,3,3,7,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,Tenderness is a kind of sad love.

3/14/14 11:02,3/14/14 11:44,110,0,0,1,1,0,1,Best example of when I felt pity for someone was when my brother was hospitalized for a long period of time when he was 13 or so years old. Had to visit him all the time and watch him go through it. He has a lot of serious allergies and his body rejects a lot of things that we would take for granted and see as harmless. I felt kind of helpless in the situation; and still have a lack of trust for healthcare professionals due to some misdiagnosises that were involved. I thought about the truths behind the statements that modern healthcare is a business; and institutionalized to extremes that only focus on the finances and quantity of care. Procedures are completed as quickly as possible and in large volumes to maximize profit.  /  / Thats all I was thinking about; while wishing I could take his place. ,I've never felt tenderness toward anyone; besides my parents. Mostly my mother. I only felt this way when there was something else tragic going on in our lives that brought us closer together (father being in hospital; death of relative; etc.). /  / The emotions that we are being testing about in this study; while I said they are all different; are emotions that come about largely together in groups. I think that in the situations I'm recalling; tenderness was just a feeling of sensitivity. I was aware that my mother and I were both emotionally sensitive during these times; and we wanted to protect eachothers emotions from being disrupted too badly.,Compassion in my mind is just an idea; it is a much less concrete word than the others we have encountered so far in this study. I don't think that I have ever necessarily felt compassion for someone. I have felt pity; sympathy; and empathy; but never consciously realized that I was feeling compassion. I think that compassion is just a filler word that people use as a substitute for the other words we are considering. That's not to say that they should be grouped together; because again; I don't think the word has any merit or direct translation to a concrete feeling. Then again; people tell me I am pretty stoic and lack basic human emotions. ,I have an older sister that dated an asshole for a solid 5 years or so. When they split; my sister was devistated; and had a hard time with it. Being the only sibling around her age; she came to me for a lot of the support she needed; and talked to me about it often. I haven't dated much through school or my lifetime; I prefer to mess around until my life as a professional adult and actual contributor to society settles down. I didn't feel empathy for her because I've never met a girl that I had a significant emotional attachment to. I more felt sympathy toward her only because of the way she described the rough process of letting go. The only thing I did for her was listened; and reminded her of the tell-tale signs that he wasn't a real winner (he peed sitting down).  /  / I also shared with her my (kind of grave and dark) views on dating and relationships. I don't think I have an easy time getting attached to people because every characteristic you find and come to 'love' in someone can be easily found in other people you meet in your every day life. ,Cannot recall a specific experience of feeling empathy for someone. Can only recall times when I watched someone go through something that I went through that was difficult physically or mentally; such as work or school. I only observed how they reacted and went through the process; but didn't have any emotional connection with them. ,1,4,0,1,3,2,,,,,,1,1,7,1,2,5,1,1,5,6,7,3,1,7,1,7,1,1,5,6,7,1,5,4,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,1. Fear / 2. Sadness / 3. Anger,Pity again is not the same thing as love. Love is not an emotion but a need and reaction to extreme positive emotions you feel over a period of time.

3/14/14 11:02,3/14/14 11:50,111,0,0,0,0,0,0,During a math exam in my high school. I had already finished my exam and knew I was gauranteed an A in the advanced calculus class because of my hard work and dedication. However; my girlfriend on the other hand was on the bridge between an A or a B ; meaning she desperately needed an A on that final particular exam to get an A in the overall class. I finsihed my exam early as stated above; and my girlfriend has sat behind me; as she usuall sat near me during exams so I can help her out. Except this time I saw she was struggling to succeed and I knew that was stressing out which made things only worse for her and I knew if this kept up she would ruin her chances of getting an A in the class but also maybe even getting a poor grade. I lifted up my test from time to time and even rsiked getting cuahg myself from how obvious I was being; even classmates around me saw me and warned me to stop before I got caught. I was even frustrated because I kept on yelling my girlfriends name; Nora; and telling her to simply copy what I wrote down in my exam so she can get the A and move on. However; knowing her she panics at certain situations; she stressed out and the fact that the professor was so near us only made things worse. At that moment it reminded my how calm and strategic I am at these situations and how nervous; stressful and fearful she was. I felt pitty towards her for not copying and landing that solid A on her report card because she was so close. ,A clear example of when I felt tenderness was when my mother came back from a long day at work and by the look of her face I could tell she was exhausted and for some reason it broke my heart to see my mother working that hard just so she could provide for us and secure a successful future for her kids. Amongst the current fight occuring between me and my siblings; two older sisters; I immediately stopped for the sake of my mothers tiresome day and decided to do it for her so she could have the rest she desrves. At that  moment I felt tenderness towards my  mother. ,A time when I felt compassion was for my junior year high school teacher for the Albanian class; Teuta Kafexholli. She was explaining the hard work she had been through that resulted in her PHD and it was really emotional for me because she had always been one of my favorite teachers due to her affectionate and lovable character. While she explained the difficulties in her journey towards attaining her PhD; she was still expressing a great deal of passion towards the subject and how she was in complete awe during her research and something she enjoyed rather then let bring her down. At that moment; I felt compassion towards her character and the influential person that she was. ,Duing my english class in junior year of high school at the American School of Kosovo. By far not only the most inflential teacher of my life; but also one of the most inlfuential person in general in my life. Joseph Day was an unusual character; and strange in his ways; but by far something inspiring amongst humanity. His words of wisdom had the ability to rapidly change your mood and make you questions the things in life you thought were most certain. One day in class we were being so loud and annoying; as usual in Joe Day's class becuase of the excess freedom he gave us to express ourselves but that we abused; and he tried to gain our attention for a song he was going to play with a guitar about the love of his life who was far away from him physically but so near the plummet of his heart. At that moment; as he sang his heart out on his feelings for the mystery women; I felt sympathy towards Joe Day...why couldn't he be reunited with his loved one. ,,1,4,0,1,2,3,,,,,,1,1,7,1,6,7,7,1,1,6,1,1,7,7,4,7,7,7,1,1,5,3,4,1,7,7,7,7,1,4,5,4,1.

She was witty; smart; artistic; and creative; and Saundra knew no one else like her. She had spent a lot of time in Saundra's house right up until she died. All of Saundra's friends including me attended the funeral and Shiva. During the service for the funeral; I felt a lot of pity for the loss of such an inspiring figure in my friends lives. Although I felt as if I could relate and had a lot of empathy for her family as I too have lost grand-parents; I still felt a marked distance towards her family and what they were going through. I wanted to be there for Saundra as much as a I could so that she knew there were people who could; or who could try to understand her from outside her family. I went with Saundra during the Shiva on a walk and talked with her as I did under normal circumstances; but of course keeping in mind her grave loss.,I felt tenderness when my little brother was having problems at school because kids were bullying him.

I told him the kids didn't matter and they were jealous.,I felt compassion for when my friend Ryan had a health condition she was really afraid of. She was awaiting results and the anticipation was frightening her. I tried to understand that my concerns and what I was feeling which was worry of not getting my homework done was not of utmost importance.

Jake wanted to go to Princeton and the amount of effort he put into everything he did that could be related to an acceptance was unbelievable. I had never seen someone work so hard; and I felt this was a valuable virtue. I felt a kind of hopelessness (because I too was awaiting  acceptances). I first gave Jake a lot of space because I knew he was the type of guy who didn't need my sympathy. As time passed I was able to talk to him about it and make sure he knew everyone was in the same boat and talking about it would help not hurt him,I felt empathy when my friend Rhea was feeling especially guilty at getting angry at her elder relatives who  she was supposed to be showing a lot of respect for. Rhea is from a conservative Jain family and leads an incredibly modern and Western lifestyle compared to her other cousins; grandparents; aunts and uncles. When they come to visit she has difficulty connecting with them as they find her day-to-day actions sometimes rude. Rhea likes to fill up her days with activities and when she is home; she is not always completely invested in her relatives need to converse.  /  / I felt empathy because I too come from a family who has long standing traditional values and there can often be a disconnect between old generations and new generations that are further hindered  by a language barrier. It's difficult to express what we're feeling especially with this language barrier as you feel you must uphold certain values to be apart of that community. /  / I talked to Rhea; comparing our different ethnic backgrounds as we bonded over how difficult it can be to keep a good relationship with people who have become so different from.,1,4,0,1,2,3,,,,,,1,1,7,1,2,5,2,1,5,5,5,4,1,1,1,7,1,1,1,1,6,1,4,3,2,4,5,4,5,5,3,5,1.

I wanted to help support him during this tragic time but he left town before I could see him.,I felt tenderness towards a new co-worker of mine when we first started working together. He and I had just been assigned a shift together and had never previously worked together. We started talking and realized that we had many common interests and our personalities matched very well. I began to really enjoy my time working with him and thought that we were becoming pretty good friends.,I felt compassionate for one of my friends who had been going through a very tough week and eventually broke down and started cutting herself with a razor. At first I was angry with her because she had displayed this behavior in the past and I encouraged her to stop. After the initial anger had settled; I began to talk to her and tried to comfort her. I knew that she was going through a rough time and her sadness sort of made me feel sad too.,I felt a bit sympathetic towards one of my friends who had broken up with his girlfriend. They had been dating for a couple of months and seemed like a happy couple. One day however; he seemed a bit down and told me that they had just broken up. I felt sympathetic towards him because I knew how happy he was with her. We talked for a bit and I think that made him feel a bit better.,One situation where I felt empathetic towards someone occured when one of my best friends in high school got accepted into a top ranked university. Since he was one of my good friends; I knew how hard he had worked and how dedicated to his school work he was and how much he wanted to go to this unviersity. I had recently been accepted into University of Michigan so I knew the excitement that he was experiencing and that all of his hard work had paid off. I was very happy for him and proud that he had accomplished his goal.,1,4,0,1,2,3,,,,,,1,1,7,,3,4,2,1,3,3,4,3,1,7,4,3,1,1,7,7,4,4,3,6,2,2,6,5,6,6,2,3,1. Anger / 2. Grief / 3.

I try to give him the benifit of the doubt an excuse his behavior on the grounds that he doesn't know any better because he's an idiot or is otherwise impaired in the area of person to person comunication.

I don't know how Brad came to be homeless; but it was probably not totally his fault; and I feel like people look down on the homeless and people begging for cash. I remebered that most of the the money I have and most of my possesions I didn't work for. They were given to me. What right did I have to hold back some money from Brad when it wasn't ""my"" money in the first place.",Several of my friends were close to a woman named Joanna; who I did not know personaly.

3/14/14 12:53,3/14/14 13:49,115,0,0,0,0,0,0,1) I time I felt pity for someone was when I was in 7th grade and I saw a kid eating alone at lunch. When I saw this I immediately felt really bad for him and kind of just thought about what he was thinking. / 2) I was feeling sad for him because I could only imagine what it must feel like to be the only one in the cafeteria sitting alone. And I was thinking that I should do something about the situation because I was taught to do the right and kind thing by my parents. / 3) What I wanted to do was sit with him so he didn't feel as lonely. I ended up getting a group of my friends to go sit with him and just try to make his day a little better. When I sat down I made it seem like it wasn't awkward at all; and I just started talking to the kid as if he was a friend of him. I could see him getting comfortable with my friends and me and that made me feel pretty good inside. ,1) A time I felt tenderness toward someone was a couple years ago when my friend's mother passed away. He was in such a fragile state of mind that I didn't really know what I could say to him.  I just wanted to show him that I was there for him if he needed anything. / 2) Seeing a friend of mine that upset made me pretty upset; as well. I was feeling tender towards his feelings and emotions. I was thinking that I should talk to him a lot to take his mind off of the situation and show he had a friend there for him.  / 3) What I wanted to do was get him to cheer up. I know that sounds ridiculous and impossible for someone in his state; but that is what I wanted to do. What I ended up doing was going to his house almost every day for the next two weeks to hang out with him even though there were other things I would have rather done. When I spoke to him; I didn't mention what was going on at all; because I knew the second I left he would think about his mother again. I was tender towards his feelings in the sense that I watched what I said to him and really just felt unbelievably bad for his situation.,,1) The first example that comes to my mind when I think of a time I was sympathetic would be when my friend got his calculus exam score and it was pretty bad. Being in the Ross Business School was something he really wanted to do; and this test grade really hurt his chances. I felt sympathetic towards him becuase I really did feel bad. I was talking to him for a while and telling him it was still possible to get in to the Business School even though I didn't know if that was true. I just remembered back in high school when I felt doing poorly on one of my tests would prevent me from getting into the college of my choice. I remembered how upset I was at the time; but looking back on it now; it was a wake up call and helped me grow as a student. Having this prior experience helped me talk to my friend about his grade and made me feel sympathetic towards him/  / 2) I was feeling really bad for him because he is a good friend of mine. I knew he would do the same thing for me if I was down; so I just tried to stay positive with him. I was thinking what I would be feeling if I were in his shoes; and what someone could say to make me feel better. When I thought of that; I said those words to my friend and I could see some sort of optimism rising in him which made me feel a lot better. / 3) I wanted to let him know that it was still possible for him to be admitted. I didn't want to see him upset or doubting himself; so I stayed up for a while and even got him food to let him know that he had support. I just kept repeating how it's only one test and it's not as big of a deal as he is making it. How I've gone through this before and felt the same way. It's a lot easier to feel sympathy towards someone if you've been in their shoes before. ,"1)  A time I felt empathetic towards someone was a couple days ago when my friend's phone and computer were stolen. The technology costs a lot of money so I generally just felt bad for him. / 2) I was feeling like there was nothing I could really do for him; and he kind of just had to deal with it himself. I was thinking whether there was something I could do; but not trying to sound selfish; the situation didn't involve me in the slightest and honestly it didn't really need my involvement. / 3) What I wanted to do was buy him a new computer and phone; but I wasn't going to do that because of the money. What I did was going through the legal procedure about his stolen items. What I said was ""sorry man; that really sucks. if you need to borrow my computer for an hour or two let me know."" That's all I could really do; since my words weren't going to bring his computer and phone back.",1,3,0,2,1,0,,1,,,,3,2,5,1,5,2,6,5,1,2,3,2,7,2,7,7,3,2,2,2,7,2,6,3,7,5,7,2,4,2,5,7,1. motivated / 2.  / 3. ,I definitely would not call pity a type of love. ,I think this is a true statement because if you think of the situation where I felt pity; both words could techinically be used for how I felt. ,1,1,7,1,1,6,2,1,7,6,7,5,1,1,1,7,1,1,4,1,7,1,7,6,7,7,2,1,5,6,4,7,1. compassion / 2. sympathy / 3. ,I would call tenderness a kind of love.

I felt bad because at this point because they would start to receive less applause then everyone else and would sometimes even be walking. I never finished in the bottom 10% of a race; although I was not fast; but still seeing these people struggle along at the end was difficult to watch. I wanted to walk away and not be there because it made me uncomfortable but instead I just kept clapping and yelling words of encouragment to my teammates who were in this position. ,,A time I felt compassion for someone was when I was there for my girlfriend when she found out her father passed away. She got a phone call saying that he had died and I was there when she found out so I did my best to help her deal with it. There was little I could say but I was just physically by her side all day giving her someone to cry on and trying to be compassionate to what was evidently an extremely difficult situation. I wanted to talk to her and tell her it would be okay and get her to smile but that was not really feasible because she was so distraught. ,I felt sympathetic for my Dad when he was watching his father slowly deteriorate due to Alzheimers. I never knew him before the disease so it did not have as profound of an impact on me but I saw what it did to my dad and felt very sympathetic for him that he had to go through such a difficult experience. I would just try and be there for him when it going on and let him know even though his dad didnt remember him I remembered and loved mine. ,I often empathize with a  person who has struggled on an exam a friend of mine did not do well on a recent test and I feel for them in this situation becasue i have been there myself. Doing well always feels nice but when you do bad it feels ten times worse and I can really put myself in their shoes.

She's chemisty major so she felt extra pressure to perform well on the exam and in the class. It seemed like she was well prepared and I had quizzed her several times and she had done pretty well. When the exam finally happened she told me afterwards that she wasn't confident about the answers to any of the questions and had pretty much panicked during the exam. I kind of blew this off and just told her that it probably went just fine and she would just have to wait until the results came out. Eventually she got her grade back and ended up getting a D. She was really upset and I felt sorry for her. There wasn't much I could say to put a positive spin on it and I just had to watch her be miserable. I know how much it sucks to get a bad grade and watching her go through it made me just hope she would get over it soon. ,A family friend of ours had a child recently and after about a month I got to see the new family. They came over to our house one afternoon and I was really excited to see the new baby and to see him with his child. He was a guy I had known for years and was always ablw to see as a future father. Finally seeing him with his baby was absolutely adorable and I was so proud of him. He looked exhausted and happy and I couldn't help but get caught up in all of the emotions. ,When my sister broke up with her boyfriend she was very distraught even though it had been her decision. I picked her up from school and she had obviously been crying and was still very upset. I was a little startled at first because I never see her so overly upset but that was part of what made me the most concerned. I immediately asked her what had happened and let her just talk about it as much or as little as she wated to. We got home and she quickly disappeared to her room. At the time; we were on the same crew team so when it was amost time for practice I went up to check on her. She was still just as upset and so I sat with her and hugged her and rubbed her back to calm her down. I wanted to do anything that would help her feel better but in the situation there wasn't a lot I could do. She didn't want to go to practice or in public so I let her convince me to tell our coach that she was sick and wouldn't be at practice that say. Even though I was a captain and almost felt guilty about making an excuse for her; I wanted to protect her and give her time and space to do what she needed to do. I did this because I felt compassionate towards her and that made me want to help her. ,I had a friend who was an excellent rower. She was working with the Junior National Development Team during the summer and was looking at getting recruited by colleges. Unfortunately; just in her senior year; she started having horrible migranes and was getting sick pretty regularly. We raced in a double together during the spring and were winning every event we entered. Until we got to regionals. We were expecting to perform just as well as we had been but when we got into the semifinal it turned out we had the fastest three boats in our semi and only three went through to finals. We finished 4th by just over a second but would have come in 1st in the other heat. When we got off the water we put our boat away and were so upset that we left our whole team and cried behind the bathroom for a solid 20 minutes. It was horrible watching our hard work not pay off or even be given a chance because of something random like the lane draw. It was even worse to see her not succeed in her last chance at regionals.,When I was rowing in high school; I had a teammate who had unprotected sex and was really worried about getting pregnant. She was talking to several other girls on the team and trying to figure out how to get Plan B. At the time I felt sorry for her and could completely understand why she was so panicked and need to treat this as an emergency. However; I also was a bit disappointed about how she got herself into the situation in the first place. I was entirely willing to help her get everything sorted out but I didn't know what to say to make her calm down. I didn't want to make the situation seem like it wasn't a big deal or like it was totally ok that this had happened.

So what I did; I was gentle and passive yet firm when interacting with the child.,,My mom's friend is trying to adopt two children; one that is three years old and another that is one year old.  The reason for the adoption of those specific children is because they grew up in a very poor living environment.  The birth mother was addicted to cocaine and had an alcohol problem.  She was very neglectful and often left the children home alone with a complete stranger to the children or with a child that is seven years old.  I felt sympathetic because I felt sorry for them but I could not completely understand what they are going through since I never experienced that in my life.  I wanted to provide support for the family that wanted to adopt them and I did give them support and helped them by being a good reference.  I told them they had to get the children no matter what it takes.,I felt empathy towards my brother when his girlfriend had an affair on him.  He was deeply in love with her but she did not feel the same way.  So instead of ending it; she decided to go for another person outside the relationship while being in one with my brother.  I was empathetic because I was in a similar situation with my previous relationship.  So I understand what he was going through and I wanted to comfort him and show him that it will be ok and not all of his relationships will be like that.  During that time; I was sorry for him and I wanted him to be better emotionally.,1,0,1,1,2,0,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,5,3,1,5,5,6,1,1,4,2,3,1,1,1,5,1,1,1,4,5,1,6,1,5,6,4,1,4,6,5,6,1.

One girl I know has no self esteem so she sleeps around with so many guys to reassure herself that she is pretty. I pity her because what she is doing is not good and I feel bad because she's trying to deal with a greater problem. ,When my Dad's dad died I felt tenderness for him immediately after it happened because he was very fragile and vulnerable. He cried and I never see him cry. ,When I was in Lima; Peru I felt compassion towards the little children who were much less fortunate than I was. I taught them how to brush their teeth and gave them toothbrushes because they didn't have any. ,When my best friend and I both failed our chem test I felt sympathy towards her when I was trying to comfort her because I could relate and we were both in it together. ,The other day a woman came to give a talk about her mother and best friend both dying of cancer in order to raise money for her foundation. It was extremely sad and emotional and many of us started crying. I felt empathy towards her because I felt sad and and wanted to show her that I cared and was concerned. However; I have never experienced a close family member or friend dying of cancer so I couldn't relate to her on the same level. We just showed our support for her cause and comforted her the best we could. ,1,4,0,1,3,2,,,,,,1,1,7,1,4,2,2,1,1,2,5,2,4,1,5,4,7,7,1,1,4,6,3,6,2,2,7,7,3,3,2,3,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,I wouldn't call pity love.

They tried to do the right thing (spare the kid); but instead got attacked by terrorists. They were more than capable of handling normal dangerous situations; but horribly evil people overwhelmed them and killed them. So even though they had the skills to do the right thing and deal with the consequences that would normally follow; they got extremely unlucky and were brutally killed for pretty much no reason whatsoever. ,I brought my brother some water when he was sick. ,I feel compassion towards my family in general.

3/18/14 9:58,3/18/14 10:47,123,0,0,0,0,0,0,Pity is what I feel when I hear about someone who went drunk driving. They could have an alcohol problem that caused this or just be plain stupid but either way I feel a disgusting sadness for them. Sadness that they cannot get counseling to get over their addiction. Sadness and disgust that they think that their life is more important than others on the road. I pity them and their small brain. I have no respect for them. I cannot relate to them because I think they are too selfish and too out of control with their life. I do not generally like the people I feel this pity towards.,One day during summer football practice; my friend Matt injured his thumb. I know that is not a big deal or anything; however he still needed surgery and would be out the first couple weeks of the season. I went over to comfort him and I felt a tenderness towards him. I knew he was upset so I tried to keep the conversation lighthearted and just tried to make him feel better. It was not something that was a huge deal but I knew it made him upset that he could not begin the season with the team; all because of a little thumb. I feel sorry for him; but not like sympathy because I knew the sadness he had would be a very temporary thing. ,This is what I feel for little children with fatal illnesses or who do not have enough food it eat. They have no control over the situation and I feel like I should help them. I feel as though they do not have control; but since I have enough to eat I should have some control. I feel bad; and an obligation towards them. An obligation to help them. ,I knew what my friend Jenna was going through when her Grandma dies of cancer. Mine had passed away previously and we were very close; so knew what it was like to feel what she was feeling. I knew how it effected her; and I felt like a could really be there for her because I had experienced it myself. ,Empathy is when you feel sorrow for someone; but you have never experienced this kind of sorrow yourself. When my best friend's mother died of cancer; I felt empathy for her in her situation; but I truly did not understand the sorrow she was going through. I felt sad; I knew her mother very well; however not in the same way that she did. Her emotions were deeper than mine could ever be; and unless my mom died I could not feel these same type of emotions. Because my emotion couldn't really relate to her emotion I consider it empathy. ,1,4,0,3,1,2,,,,,,1,1,7,1,3,4,3,1,1,1,6,1,6,5,7,2,7,7,1,1,1,6,2,4,3,1,7,7,5,1,1,2,1. disgust / 2. sadness / 3. disapproval,No it is not love,Yes; because having contempt for something is having disapproval of the situation (I believe) and if this is true then they are the same emotion,1,1,6,1,7,1,4,1,6,3,1,3,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,2,4,6,7,3,4,1,2,1,2,3,6,1. motherly-ness / 2. sad / 3. kindness,It would be a kind of love; tenderness is taking care of someone when they are vulnerable; and making them feel better.

3/18/14 9:58,3/18/14 10:45,124,0,0,0,0,0,0,When girls were making fun of one of my friends at school in a very immature way; I felt pity towards them because I knew that they were only being mean and putting my friends down to feel better about themselves.  The mean girls were making fun of them because they were self conscious about themselves and thought that making fun of other people would make them feel better.  I felt sad to see my friends getting made fun of; but at the same time I felt bad that the mean girls felt the need to do it.  I talked to my friends and convinced them that the mean girls were not worth getting upset about.,A friend of mine lost one of her best friends in a tragic accident.  Before she lost her friend; we were good friends but not that close.  After she lost her friend; I wanted to be there for her and take care of her.  I went out of my way to make sure she was doing okay and helped her out a lot.  The emotion of tenderness in this situation was my desire to take care of her. ,Whenever I see homeless people on the street that ask my for money; I feel compassion.  I want to do everything that I can to help them; but I am lost as to what that is most of the time.  I usually offer them money or offer to buy meals for them. ,A friend of mine was telling me about conflicts that she had been having with her parents that she was very upset about.  I had never experienced the same thing; but I felt really bad for her and wished that it had not happened.  I couldn't relate to what was happening; but still tried to help think of solutions and something to do about it.,One of my friends was upset about her future.  She was stressed out and crying about if the major she chose is the right one for her and felt scared because it would be too late to change her major.  Then she was talking about how she wanted to make a difference; have an impact; etc.  This is something that I have felt before.  I also struggled a little bit with choosing my major and being sure that it is the right thing to do.  At the time that it happened to me; I was able to make a pro con list; seriously consider my other options; but then realize that I was just being crazy and saying these things because I was stressed out.  When my friend was telling me how she was feeling; I felt really bad for her because I knew what she was going through and I knew how hard it was to feel like that.  I could relate to how she was feeling.  I tried to ask her the questions that I had also asked myself; and I shared my fears and thought process with her.  I also reassured her that everyone goes through the same thing.  ,1,4,0,2,1,3,,,,,,1,1,5,1,3,2,2,1,1,1,5,1,5,6,6,7,5,5,3,4,4,4,2,4,3,3,6,4,4,3,2,3,1. upset / 2.  mad / 3. annoyed,not love,I don't think this is true because pity is more of looking down on someone but realizing why and feeling bad for them.

3/18/14 10:00,3/18/14 10:38,125,0,0,0,0,0,0,I pity my friend Zach because he is struggling to do what he wants. He went to GVSU for one semester while running track there and hated both the school and track because both were physically and mentally exhausting him. Running 13 miles a day was not good for him. So the next semester he decided to come home and go to a local community college to save money and find direction for a better program for his education. However; in doing this; he lost all of his friends from GVSU; lost a hobby that defined him; and put himself into a very boring and embarrassing situation by admitting defeat at GVSU and transferring to a lesser school. Being at home is boring for him and eats at his self-confidence. Also; he wants to transfer to U of M in the fall; but his GPA was too low at GVSU so he couldn't even apply for that term. He'll have to take another semester at the community college. Also; his parents told him if he came home and went to community college they would buy him a car; and have thus taken that back and have not yet bought him a car. His situation is awful and I pity everything about his life.,I feel tenderness towards my roommate Emma almost every day. Knowing that she is depressed and very sensitive; I have to walk on eggshells so as to avoid hurting her feelings. It's not easy because sometimes I feel like I could just slap her out of it; but I know that it doesn't work like that. So I take a more tender perspective when I try to talk to her or confront her or help her. I know that I can't be as blunt as I would be with other people and I can't joke around as much either. She is hypersensitive to people that make fun of her so I try to stay away from those kinds of jokes. The tenderness that I feel is towards her feelings; to save her from being more depressed.,I felt compassion for my mother when her close friend's husband died. He had cancer for a very long time and was doing very well recovering; but also had other health problems. Eventually he was put into the hospital and given a few days to live; while his comprehension and speech abilities were deteriorating. His family had to watch him die; in the cold hospital; and still manage to be okay for a funeral. My mother; however; would stay with them in the hospital; talk to her friend on the phone for hours; and offer the best advice she could. The situation seemed impossible and I could never imagine being able to stay strong on the phone or in the hospital while someone's life was being destroyed. It was very sad but the compassion I felt for my mother for being such a good support system for her friend.,I feel sympathy for my friend Shelby; who lives in the room above me and also has roommate problems. Her roommate Amy is very loud in the mornings; is disrespectful when around her friends; acts very self-absorbed; and is very conceited. Shelby is very nice and doesn't usually confront her; knowing that Amy would just take offense and make it a bigger deal than necessary. I sympathize because I have similar problems with my roommate and other friends and I know that it's not really in her hands to fix.,,1,0,1,0,3,2,,,,1,,1,1,7,1,1,7,1,1,1,5,7,2,6,7,7,5,5,6,7,7,6,7,4,6,2,3,7,7,4,7,7,4,1.

3/18/14 9:55,3/18/14 10:34,126,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,One time one of my friends was incredibly stressed out over school and other parts of life in general.  She came to me to vent out all of her feelings.  She had four exams that week that she had been studying for at least seven hours a day for the past two weeks because she had so much pressure to succeed in all of her classes.  Her parents told her that if she didn't get an a on all of her tests that she was going to be grounded.  I helped her study for the rest of the week and tried to make sure she wasn't panicking too much about it.  She ended up getting a's on all her exams.,Earlier this year; my best friend's girlfriend's sister had her sister killed in a car crash.  She and her sister were incredibly close and called each other their best friend.  Both of these girls were known for being very sweet and caring girls.  When I heard the news I immediately started crying.  I couldn't even imagine what it would be like to lose a sister and a best friend; especially in such a tragic and random way. ,It was a few days in to the track season and we were running our first workout.  I was up front with one of my best friends leading the workout.  Coming around one of the turns he fell to the ground in pain.  He had twisted his leg and ended up tearing a ligament in his knee.  This injury would cause him to miss the entire season as one of our top runners.  I could empathize with the situation because just the year before I had broken my ankle two days before the track season started in the year that I was going to be in the varsity lineup for the first time.,1,0,1,2,1,0,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,1,6,1,5,2,6,1,2,6,3,3,2,5,1,6,3,3,5,4,6,3,6,4,5,5,5,2,4,5,5,6,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,It would be the kind of love that you have for a brother or sister,1,1,7,1,1,7,1,1,2,6,7,2,1,6,1,7,1,1,6,6,7,2,7,6,4,5,2,1,7,7,2,7,1. extreme sadness / 2. distraught / 3. ,The sympathy from this situation made me feel very close to the person who I was not particularly close to before.

As it died I tried to comfort it because it was coughing up blood and truly needed help that was beyond its reach.,I honestly cant remember a single time in my life where i felt sympathy for someone. It has always been an all or nothing between full blown empathy and complete emotional detachment. ,When I was younger I used to watch a lot of TV. Eventually I noticed that there were certain situations within sitcoms that I could not bare to watch. They always tended towards beings situations in which the protagonist is in a... sketchy... situation. Particularly I remember watching and episode of the Cosby's were Theo had gotten his ear pierced. He had done it without the premission of either of his parents ad illegally as well. He went to his friend's house and essentially had a needle shoved through his ear. As time went on; his ear began to become green and infected and his ability to hide what he had done waned. So it came to a climax where Theo's farther found out what he had done and confronted him. The scene filled me with a sense of heart wrenching shame for Theo as well as a fear for the near future and his well-being. ,1,3,0,2,0,1,,,1,,,1,1,7,1,1,7,2,1,3,2,7,3,1,4,1,7,2,4,2,2,7,1,1,3,4,5,7,7,6,6,2,5,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,pity isnt a type of love.

He has been a recreational drug users for years and his parents constantly warn him to stop doing drugs; but he still refused  to listen and wound up in a court ordered rehab center.  I felt bad for him because I knew him before he started using drugs and he was one of my good friends but after he started using he became a completely different person.  I wanted to tell him that he was ruining his life when he was using but I knew that he wouldn't listen or take me seriously.  ,I felt a tenderness towards my sister when she did poorly on one of her math tests.  I'm not the best math student by any means; and she generally has a way better grasp on math than I do.  So when she got a score that she typically wouldn't get; I tried to comfort her and let her know that there were going to be plenty more math tests for her to take and that she could bounce back from this one easy.  She seemed to like hearing that; and I was happy that I made her feel a little bit better. ,A time when I felt compassion towards someone is when they lost a loved one.  It was a really good friend of mine whose grandfather passed away who he was extremely close with.  I felt sorry for what he had to go through and I wanted him to know that I was there in case he needed anything to help comfort him.  He said thank you and he really appreciated it and I felt like I had helped make him feel a little bit better.,I felt sympathy towards my friend whose brother passed away from a drug overdose.  We played baseball together for a few years and the family is one of the nicest families I have ever met but the middle brother had a crippling addiction.  One day he disappeared in the middle of the night and his body was found the next morning.  My friend was devastated and I felt like I couldn't do anything to make him feel better.  It was tough ; but the only thing I knew that I could do was to support him in his time of need and be there in case he needed me for anything.   ,,1,3,1,0,2,0,,,,1,,1,1,7,1,2,3,1,1,6,2,2,1,5,3,5,3,7,7,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,3,2,3,3,1,1,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,I would not call pity a type of love. ,I do not think this is true.,1,1,7,1,7,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,5,6,1,1,2,6,4,3,2,2,7,7,1,2,2,2,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,I would say a tenderness is a gentle type of love.

3/18/14 10:01,3/18/14 12:00,129,0,0,0,0,0,0,1) When. in high school; a test would a be schedule; a teacher would usually allow a class period for review.  When during this review session I had classmates who would ask questions that were very;very basic I felt pity.  When they asked questions that reflected a complete lack of understanding for the topic at hand I felt badly for them because I realized what a long read they had ahead in learning the material and then applying it on the exam. /  / 2) I felt badly for them; knowing how far they had to go and seemingly how foolish they may have looked to others; asking questions that reflected so poorly on their understanding. /  / 3) I wanted to explain the concepts to them privately if I had the ability; or take it upon myself to make sure they had the knowledge and could apply it properly.  Pity came with a kind of need to remedy the problem myself.,1) When I was leaving for college; I had had a boyfriend of almost three years.  We did not discuss our situation going forward until the day before he was supposed to leave for school.  When we did discuss it though; we both cried and agreed that logistically and realistically the only option would be separation; even though we were both very aware of the fact that we still loved each other.  When I saw him start to cry I felt overwhelming tenderness.  I wanted to comfort him and soothe him.  I felt badly for him but did not look down on him in any way. /  / 2) I felt pulled in two directions.  I loved him and currently love him dearly but that didn't and doesn't make me think that we could have had a healthy long distance relationship. /  /  / 3)I both wanted to tell him what he wanted to hear; that we could stay together; but I also knew I couldn't do that because it was a lie.  I didn't think staying together was the correct path for either of us but I desperately wanted to go against that instinct to make him feel better.  So instead I cried with him and we commiserated together about something we could not change. / ,"1) At a party I attended I was told that there was a girl in the bathroom that needed help.  She was very intoxicated and was vomiting.  The men at the party felt that they could not help her sufficiently. When I entered the bathroom her face was resting on the seat of the toilet and she was dry heaving.  I had never before met this girl; and knew her only through a mutual acquaintance.  I felt very badly for this girl but also wanted to help her; and the two bred compassion. /  / 2) I was disgusted but at the same time realized that I was the only one with the faculties to help her.  She desperately needed help and that made me want to help her. Despite not knowing her; I felt an instinct to help another woman of my age in a bad situation and couldn't turn away knowing it ""wasn't my problem"". /  / 3) I had to show kindness and tenderness to gain her trust and eventually we got her home.  At that point I could no longer help her because she asked us to leave because she wanted to be alone.  She never thanked me.",1) I was riding on a bus in downtown Los Angeles when I looked out the window and saw a man walking down the street dressed in trash bags from head to toe.  He was shuffling along as the bus passed by and on his face was a look of agonized sorrow that I've never seen.  I felt sympathy because this man was obviously in emotional pain; but I could not understand that pain.  I could not put myself in that situation and did not understand from where his pain was coming.  I desperately wanted to help him but I felt there was nothing I could do.  I think my sense of sympathy was heightened because of the atmosphere on the bus.  On the bus were 50 or so nicely dressed lawyers and clerks from the Los Angeles Criminal Court on their way home from work.  This socioeconomic; psychological; and well-being juxtaposition further made me feel for this man.  Additionally it was a very hot day and there is no way he could have been at a comfortable temperature.  /  / 2) It made me feel almost guilty for having the things I had when this man had nothing.  And I've seen homeless people before but I've never had this type of reaction.  I think it was the fact that the bags didn't even fit him correctly that really sent me into a tailspin.  If he is going to wear bags; shouldn't they at least fit him? Shouldn't he be given that decency? It made me hyper-conscious of the inequality of the standard of living experience by people in the same country; in the same state and city.   /  / 3) I felt powerless to help him; like he was just caught in this viscous machine.  There are currently and have been in the past a great number people who have dedicated their lives to trying to solve this issue and have not been successful.  Despite how badly I wanted to help hi; I knew there was nothing I could personally do and it made me even more sympathetic because he seemed caught and without chance of help.  So I watched him trudge for as long as I could before the bus turned a corner.  And then I fought back tears.,1) When I watch sports I always feel empathy for the losing team; especially toward the player on whose play the game ends.  They probably feel badly about themselves; and when I have been in that position; I have felt badly about myself.  /  / 2) I understood their situation by means of having experienced it before.  There is a pit in one's stomach and a feeling of guilt that only failure can elicit.  Even in a team sport; if you are the last out; or miss the last shot; or miss the last field goal; the energy of the loss seems to revolve around your actions.  It's a horrible feeling and the loss weighs heavily. /  / 3) I always want to tell the team that lost that sometime in the future they will be the winners.  Granted when I 'm the one losing that's not what I want to hear.  When I'm the loser I want to hear that it's not my fault and that some other factor caused me and/or the team to preform badly. ,1,4,0,3,1,2,,,,,,1,1,5,1,2,1,4,1,2,1,6,7,6,1,6,6,4,4,4,4,7,4,2,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,3,5,1. / 2.  / 3. ,I do not think it's a type of love.,I think there can be an element of contempt.

3/18/14 10:44,3/18/14 11:45,130,0,0,0,0,0,1,In China; everyone needs to take a entrance exam to get into college. But different with the SAT in America; people can take the exam only one time. Due to large population and limited good schools; the competition is very intense and a lot of people can't go to their dream schools. One of my friends; who scored one point away from the school he wanted to go to made me feel pity about him. At the same time; I felt sad and useless. I knew I couldn't do anything about it but I thought he should have gone to his dream school. He was so close. So I talked to him; said sorry and invited him to hang out with me in order to make him happier.,The moment I felt tenderness was when I was spending time with one of my best friends. She just broke up with his boyfriend whom she had been with for nearly five years. We went out with other friends for Karaoke and as she was singing a love song with tremble voices; I felt that something softest in my heart was touched. I didn't feel sympathy for her; but the feeling was resulted from her sadness and despair. I knew I had to do something about it and I wanted to help her. I sat down besides her and hugged her as she began crying. We have been close friends for more than six years and until today; I still remember the feeling of that moment.,"I remember one of the formally famous singers in China was caught taking drugs. The scandal spread quickly and soon he disappeared on all kinds of TV and magazines. After nearly ten years; he finally came back to the stage and said:"" The only thing that kept me strong the past ten years was that I still love singing and I want to sing for all of you. Thank you so much for letting me on the stage again."" And at that point; I felt compassion for him. I wanted to forgive him for all he did and the bad influence he had on the society. I thought I could understand his urge and his pain. I was at the same time very happy to see him back on the stage again and win over those drugs.",,I don't think I remember anything special about empathy.

3/18/14 10:45,3/18/14 11:59,131,0,0,0,0,0,0,When my little brother wasn't getting the playing time he deserved on the basketball team; I felt pity for him. If he weren't good enough to be playing; I wouldn't feel that at all; but since the coaches weren't treating him fairly; I really felt pity for him .,"I was home for spring break with 13 of my friends a few weeks ago. Just 3 weeks prior to getting home for break; one of my two dogs passed away. Of course I was upset; but the emotion my mother was going through was brutal. On the Friday of spring break; my friends left and I had two days to spend just with my family. My mom was just getting over the loss of our first dog Otis when my dad got back from the Vet with my second dog. When my mom asked how she was; my dad bluntly responded; ""we need to talk."" They went into my dad's office and within a matter of seconds I heard my mom screaming and crying. Bella; now my only dog; was just diagnosed with lung cancer and was given less than a month to live. That month only lasted two days as she passed away just hours as I came back to school on Sunday. I loved my dogs and was very upset; but mom did everything for these dogs and I could only feel tenderness for her as she lost her two best friend and hiking buddies in a matter of weeks. ",It was our football banquet senior year of high school. I was never to play a game again. When my coach began to talk about me; he couldn't even finish what he was saying before tears came to his eyes. When I went up to talk about him; I wanted to tell him to tell him that whatever he thought I did for him; he did 1000x more for me and I am extremely grateful for him. Unfortunately; before I could even get those words out; I started bawling my eyes; knowing that I was never going to play for him again. In this moment; I felt true compassion for my football coach. ,My older brother never scored a touchdown in high school football career. In our second to last game; he had a perfect opportunity to do; only to drop a touchdown in the endzone. This had no impact on the outcome of the game; but as his little brother; all I wanted was for him to catch just one touchdown pass. I still feel sympathy in my head every time I picture him dropping that pass. ,"I was in 8th grade on my way to a football game when our bus drove by a car accident. The two kids in front of me were looking and laughing when my coach turned around and said; ""yeah; you guys laugh but imagine that family is going through right now."" I was always taught that empathy is putting yourself in someone else's shoes and in this situation I put myself in the shoes of this family who could have been dealing with a relative who got either seriously injured or killed in this brutal car accident.

3/18/14 10:49,3/18/14 12:01,133,0,0,0,0,0,0,Not too long ago; my roommate left to go to a dinner with her charity group downtown. She left the apartment very enthusiastically and I expected her to not return for several hours. Within 45 minutes; however; she came back. It was easy to see her anxiety levels were extremely high. She told me that there were just too many people in the restaurant and she couldn't get herself to talk to any of them and that when she walked in and saw them; she immediately left (knowing that everyone saw her as well). I knew that my roommate was shy; but I didn't think it would hold her back from doing activities that she loved! I felt horrible for her; a sort of pity. I tried to talk to her about it; but she was so worked up that she immediately went to her room and stayed there for the rest of the night. ,When I first met cousin; just after he was born; I immediately felt tenderness towards him. Because he was so little and fragile; I immediately dropped all of the tension in my body (and mind) in order to hold and interact with him. I felt relaxed; at ease; and loving as soon as I held him. Most newborn babies are at a stage where they need to feel loved and wanted and cared for and it seems that many women carry this sort of tenderly instinct in them; so this occurred quite naturally to me.,When my fiance and I got engaged back in December; I felt compassion. When he proposed to me; it was the most pleasantly overwhelming feeling. I knew that in that moment that I said yes; I was completely devoted towards him. I wanted him to be in my life forever; and the sense of love and affection that I feel when I think of him makes me want to work hard to be the one that he always wants.,A while ago; my best friend's grandpa passed away. I went to the funeral and saw her there crying. I immediately felt sympathy. A couple years before that; my great grandmother passed away; and she was there trying to comfort me during the funeral. Now; it was me who was comforting her. I feel that considering once a person experiences something; and in then comes in contact with another person experiencing the same situation; they are more than likely to feel sympathy. I knew what my friend was going through; so I felt that my caring and patient side began to show. In order to calm her; I talked to her about things that she wanted to talk about at the time; letting her express her grief or distract herself in anyway she chose.,,1,3,2,0,1,0,,,,1,,1,1,4,1,2,2,1,1,2,2,5,3,1,2,1,6,4,4,1,1,3,5,3,2,2,1,4,5,1,2,2,3,1. sympathy / 2. sadness / 3. shock,If I were to call pity a kind of love; then it would be a more concerning love in that when I think of pity; I think of people feeling concern for those they care about.,I don't think so because at that moment; I really didn't feel any contempt as much as I did worry.,6,7,1,2,4,4,6,3,1,7,1,1,1,1,3,7,6,3,4,4,2,5,7,2,5,3,2,1,1,3,6,7,1.

3/18/14 10:49,3/18/14 11:43,134,0,0,0,0,0,1,A rival high school has always had the better football out of the two schools. But we knew that we had better academics; in a way; we pitied this of them. We thought they were stupid when they would celebrate a win even though they probably knew they were going to win. I felt bad that they had only high school football to cheer about.,My roommate had just lost a close friend and I knew that I had to be a good friend and be very nice to him because he was in vulnerable spot in life.  I had to be very nice; ask him if he was okay; and ask him what i could do. Most of all; all i could really say was im sorry.,My buddy had just gotten out of the water of his best race. He had finished second in the state but he crushed his best time but all he could think about with his second place.

He could compete with me in practice but was never able to do very well in meets like I could. At the end of his career; I was moving on to the next level and he was to be done with the sport. At this point; I felt some sympathy towards him; I felt that he deserved more because he worked hard throughout the whole training process but it never clicked at the meets. I felt sorry for him in a way that he deserved to be successful as much as I was. I really wanted for him to do well but at the end all i could tell him was; good swims; get 'em next time out.,Alabama always has the best football team in the country.

3/18/14 10:54,3/18/14 12:41,134,0,0,0,0,0,0,"On the last day of my Alternative Spring Break trip; our group had our mattresses layed out in a circle (our heads all facing each other) so that we could see each other and reflect about the day. We talked about the amazing relationships we made on the trip; and the amazing relationships we made with each other. Towards the end of the reflection; one of the girls started talking by saying ""On a more serious note..."" right at that moment I knew she was going to apologize about the way she was acting on the trip. Throughout the trip she was very bossy; stingy; and seemed to always have her own opinion about everything. She was our site leader for the trip; but didn't treat us like equals; she treated us like children. As she made her apology and talked about how she wishes she became closer to some of us and was less stressed throughout the trip. Then she started shaking as she said ""Something you all don't know about me is..."" then she stuttered; said ""um"" multiple times and it was clear that she was extremely uncomfortable about what she was about to say. Then the words came out and she told us how ever since 7th grade; she has attempted to commit suicide 3 times; and last year her roommate caught her/took her to the hospital. She told us that the past monday while we were on the trip; she had those similar thoughts again. As she told us this my hand immediately went over my mouth and I started crying. I cried so much as she told me that I couldnt even see her face. After she was done; we all simultaneously got up and surrounded her in a group embrace as she sat there shaking and crying. We were all around her silently crying for over 30 minutes. Just being next to her; and being near everyone else who now is aware of her problem; made us feel closer than ever before.",I felt tenderness towards my dance team when we had our final competition together because I have spent so many long nights practicing with them and becoming a tight knit family that this last moment on stage was one that we will never forget. We all built each other up on stage; cheered for each other; and gave it our all. I wanted to never leave them; but I knew that after this competition we wouldnt be seeing as much of each other as we used to. I still think of them as my family here on campus though; and I believe that the tenderness is something you feel for family members.,Whenever I saw my parents for the first time in a while when I first started college I would hug them and tears would start streaming because of how much I love them; and love that they are here for me. I miss them so much and when I have them here with me I feel that I never want to let them out of my sight because I don't know if they are unhappy or happy about me being so far away.,I felt sympathy towards our family friend's when their mother passed away. I was a freshman in high school and I remember just feeling awful about the situation because of how important the mother was in our community. She was also very close to my parents so I respectfully wished the family well and was there for them. I didnt have many words to say because I didn't understand what they were going through at all. All I could do was hug them as much as possible,I felt empathy for my best friend when she told me about her break up with a long term boyfriend. She seemed quite uncomfortable about the situtation/ talking about which I understood because I couldn't talk about my break up for a long time. I felt a lot of pain coming from her; and I felt that she was going through a hard time because she still loved this person and was hoping to make it work. However; I encouraged her to keep seeing her friends and cling on to the bad aspects of the relationship to help her get over him quickly. She called me; so I wasnt able to give her any physical hug or assurance; but all I could do was tell her that it will be okay in the end and this will be a good thing for her.,1,4,0,3,1,2,,,,,,1,1,7,1,1,5,5,2,4,5,7,2,1,3,2,6,3,3,5,3,5,3,5,2,5,4,5,4,4,5,5,4,1.

We were never that close yet we became friends through being on the same Science Olympiad team. As the years passed she entered university in Rhode Island and I was still in high school. One day she got a boyfriend and her happy pictures she took with him filled up my facebook wall. She looked so happy and I was happy for her. But recently; only a few months ago; her boyfriend went missing. He went on a kayaking and hunting trip and did not return home. There was a huge search and rescue mission to find him but they could not for 2 weeks. Eventually they found his body; he was dead. I felt so sad and worried for my friend. The pain she must have felt; I felt bad for her. I wanted to give her my condolences but as we were never really that close and grew even further apart in recent years I did not feel like I had a good way of telling her how I felt. I pitied her as I would hope to not have to experience that sort of pain. I hoped someone close to her would be able to comfort her.,I met a boy in middle school that was always very kind to me in my darkest moments. He was always there to talk to me even though i was one of the shyest students in the grade. I rarely ever initiated conversations with others yet he would always talk to me and make me feel more comfortable about the situation and about myself. I slowly felt this tenderness towards him. I felt like I understood his character and I really liked it. I wanted deeply to be closer as friends. I was always kind to him and he always returned the kindness. ,I felt compassion towards people I met in the hospital I volunteered at. I never met them before and rarely was able to meet with the same people each week but I felt like I had to do my best to help them out. They were all cancer patients and in need of assistance that I wanted to provide them. I felt compelled to actively help them out. I felt bad for them but at the same time a bit hopeful that they would be able to recover. I was able to talk to some of them and help make their day a little more bearable.,When my mom went ice skating when she was younger she fell and knocked out one of her front teeth. I felt bad for her. I had never had that happen to me but I felt so sad for her. I could not image how horrified I would be if that happened to me. But I am also happy that she got over it and moved on. I could not directly relate to the situation but could still place myself in her shoes and imagine how I would have felt.,I heard that some of my friends were self harming themselves. They had body image issues and were feeling down. I felt empathy towards them as I have self-harmed in the past and understood perhaps where those feelings were coming from. I also suffer from body image issues. I felt bad for them in a bit of a deeper level as I could understand where the root of the cutting came from. But I also felt a bit angry and annoyed as I knew they were also doing it for attention. They would post pictures and try to get comments of sympathy. I knew that their reasons for self-harm were not exactly the same as mine. They were not rooted in the same kind of depression as mine. I comforted my friends and helped them stop the self-harm. I tried to comfort them. But inside I still felt annoyed at the situation. ,1,4,0,1,3,2,,,,,,1,1,7,1,2,5,1,1,6,1,5,1,1,2,1,3,1,1,2,2,7,4,6,5,2,2,3,5,6,7,1,7,1. sympathy / 2. sadness / 3. shock,I would not call pity a kind of love. I think pity is more of a type of compassion (though I believe there are other types of compassion).,I do not think this is always true.

It is often the acceptance of an unfortunate event out of the victim's control (or hard to control). ,5,5,1,4,2,6,5,4,3,4,4,3,1,4,1,1,5,5,1,3,6,4,5,5,5,6,5,5,1,4,4,6,1. Happiness / 2. Jealousy / 3.

3/18/14 11:57,3/18/14 12:54,137,0,1,0,0,0,0,During my senior year of high school; two of my best friends mom's were diagnosed with cancer. For my friend Lexi's mom; the cancer had returned after 10 years. For my friend Julie's mom; it was the first time she was ever diagnosed with cancer. However; I sympathized with them. I did not pity them. When you look down upon someone with pity; it suggests that you will never be in their place. People often pity others when they lose someone or they pity homeless people. How do you know you will never be in their place. In my opinion; pity is a judgement that is unnecessary. As a result; I sympathized with my friends because maybe one day my mom will get cancer. I showed compassion. I helped out when they needed it and tried to help them have a fun senior year. Who knows where I will be five or ten years from now. It is not my place to pity others. I would not want to be pitied if I was in their position. ,Tenderness is kind of a vague emotion and can be applicable to many different kinds of people. One of the times I felt tenderness was when my 5th teacher had a heart attack. She was an incredible teacher and I was worried about how she would recover. Although she was not still my teacher when she had her heart attack; I was concerned for her safety. ,My younger sister is extremely prone to injury. In the past two years alone; she broke her foot twice and she broke her arm. She has become increasingly angry and frustrated. All she wants to do is be active. She wants to play soccer and basketball and she wants to run track but; her injuries keep getting in the way. I want to help her achieve her goals but sometimes her body will not let her. I try to encourage her to build up her strength by doing different exercise but at times it is hard. Her body is very weak.,,Right before Nationals for Irish dancing; one of my really good friends tore her ACL. A seriously invasive surgery ensued. I empathized with her because I had done the exact same thing before. Tearing an Acl and having to go through the surgical process can be extremely taxing and frustrating. I understood what she was going through. ,1,3,0,2,1,0,,,,,1,1,1,7,1,2,5,1,1,7,7,6,7,1,1,1,5,1,1,1,1,7,1,1,1,1,3,1,1,6,1,1,1, / 2.  / 3. ,I would not call pity love.

3/18/14 11:58,3/18/14 12:40,138,0,0,0,0,0,0,My best friend cheated on her boyfriend with another boy. Her old boyfriend was one of my good friends too and this was not one of the first times that she had committed such an act. This was almost like the straw that broke the camels back. She lost me as a friend. I couldn't be friends with someone who I thought was not loyal. However; she also lost a lot of her friends as well. I pitied her because she lost all of her friends and had no one to turn to. She was all alone. The reason I pitied her though was because it was all her fault; repercussions from her actions. ,"My friend had just broken up with her long time boyfriend. She called me right after it happened in hysterics. She was barely able to speak because she was crying so much. Between her tears and her heavy breathing; I could not hear what she was saying. Over the phone; I tried calming her down with little remarks such as ""it is going to be okay"" or just telling her to breathe. I felt extremely sad for her and did not understand what had happened. Questions ran through my head such as ""why did he break things off with her"" and ""is she going to be okay"". I went over to her house where we cooked chocolate chip pancakes and watched our favorite TV show One Tree Hill. I wanted to take her mind off of him and the situation; which worked. Occasionally; she would start crying; in which case I moved close to her and hugged her; letting her know I was there for her. ",I felt compassion towards my friends when they tried really hard to make my birthday special this year. Usually; I hate my birthday and the attention that comes with it. However; this year my friends made sure that I had a great birthday. They showered me with love and fun activities. I was so thankful and felt so lucky to have them as friends. I told them how special they made my birthday and I even cried out of happiness and love for them. ,,In 10th grade; my classmates and I had to take physics. I really struggled throughout the year. I got D's on all of my tests and just could not grasp the material. It was very hard for me to do so poorly in a class. My friend who was a year younger than me in school took physics when she was in 10th grade as well. Having survived the course; I helped her when she was struggling. The first test she got a 40% on. I told her that it was going to be okay. She could improve in the course and that it was only the first test. Also; there were other forms of assessments that she could do well on. ,1,3,2,0,1,0,,,,,1,1,1,7,1,2,2,1,1,1,1,3,1,7,7,7,6,7,7,1,1,5,1,1,2,2,1,7,6,1,1,1,4,1. Angry / 2.

3/18/14 11:58,3/18/14 12:54,139,0,0,0,0,0,0,Recently; a friend of mine cut her toe extremely badly on accident. For the next few days; she was complaining about how much it hurt and how she probably should have gotten stitches; but she could no longer because it was too late. While I felt bad for how much pain she was in; she should have taken herself to the doctor and gotten it fixed. It was hard for her to walk for the next few days; and it became obvious that she should go to the doctor. While I felt bad for her; she also did not help herself by not going to the doctor. It could get worse in the future; and she would regret not taking action right when it happened. ,I felt tenderness when a family friend recently had a baby. As we went to their house to meet the newborn; my family and I acted with tenderness toward the baby and toward the parents. The baby was new to this world; and we knew that it would not be good to overwhelm her. We just acted calmly; rather than being extremely rambunctious. We also wanted to be tender toward the mother; as she had just gone through many hours of birth. She was exhausted; and overwhelming her with our presence would not have helped her situation. ,,My roommate is one of the hardest working individuals I have ever met. She stays up until about 2 AM every night for a week before she has a test; and does everything necessary in order to do well. Her test grade came; and she did not do nearly as well as she had expected. I felt a large amount of sympathy for her because she worked much harder than many other people; and she did not do nearly as well as she had expected. There was really not much I could do. Even though I told her she did everything she could to do well; she did not feel that way. I tried to cheer her up and let her know that there are other tests in the class that she can do well on. ,A friend of mine struggled with her family as her dad was having issues with alcohol. This was a similar experience to me; as my dad also suffered from alcoholism. The disease can affect one's entire family very quickly. Her dad was having issues at work; just as mine was; and the two decided that the only way they could feel better was by consuming large amounts of alcohol. In her experience; this was all she could think about and was having a hard time focusing on her schoolwork. The only thing that I could do was talk to her about it; but I told her what happened in my experience and how I dealt with it. I felt empathy with her because I truly put myself in her shoes and tried to help her as much as possible. I felt empathy for my friend because I knew exactly what she was going through and how hard it must have been for her; so I wanted to let her know that I had dealt with a similar issue before. I wanted to let her know that even though it is a hard situation to be in; I had gone through a similar experience and I could show her that it was all going to be okay. ,1,3,0,2,1,0,,1,,,,2,1,7,1,2,2,3,1,1,3,4,5,2,1,1,4,7,7,1,1,3,5,3,3,2,2,7,7,2,2,2,2,1.

3/18/14 11:59,3/18/14 12:40,140,0,0,0,0,0,0,One example of pity that comes to mind; that a lot of people might have; especially in Ann Arbor; would be pertaining to homeless people. There are usually a lot of homeless people that hang out on the north end of State Street in all seasons. One of the first days I was here in Ann Arbor; I was walking with friends down State St. to go shopping. It was a hot day so there were a lot of homeless people on the street at that time. They would ask people for money as they walked by or just try to talk to them. I couldn't help but feel pity for them in their situation. In my hometown; there are not many homeless people but my parents raised me to not treat them as anything less and if they needed help; we could help however we could. So that day on State St; I pulled some ones out of my wallet and handed it to a man as I walked by. I guess I did this out of pity. However; my friends looked at me and questioned why I had done that and said that he was just going to buy drugs. I didn't really care what he did with the money; he needed it more than I did. I still see homeless people on the streets of Ann Arbor; but not always do I have money to spare. But there is still pity that comes to mind when I walk past them.,In this particular story; I used tenderness as well as compassion and sympathy; and some empathy towards someone. One of my best friends; Alissa; that I met here at school lives right across the hall from me and is roommates with my other best friend. We all knew something was wrong when Alissa wasn't replying in our group text message. When I heard her come home; I knocked on the door and she opened; tears filling her eyes. I walked her to her bed and we sat down and she just put her head on my shoulders as she told me that her grandfather had just passed away. Alissa was extremely close with her grandfather. She always talked about him and every time she went home; she would see him (they did not live far apart). I could see how incredibly sad she was over this. In these situations; it is hard to comfort someone because of how much pain they are in. There are no words that someone can say to make that pain go away. So; I let her cry on my shoulder as I rubbed her arms. We sat in silence with just the sound of her slight crying and she knew that I was there for her in any way that I could be. To use the word; I was trying to be as tender as possible with her because of her frailness of heart at the time. Eventually she stopped crying and we moved forward. She still sometimes needs to talk about it and I am always there for her.,,,"It is a smaller situation but goes along with empathy. I was at a party the other week with my sorority. A girl in the grade above me came up to a few of us girls in my grade that were dancing and said; ""Hey girls! Never; ever get into a relationship in college. Don't do it it's a bad idea."" I knew that this girl had had a serious boyfriend for a long time that she knew from home. He was now at the University in my grade. I went up to her and asked her if she had broken up with him and she said yeah and that she found out that he cheated on her a long time ago. I quickly gave her a hug and I explained that I had also been cheated on by a long term boyfriend. I told her that it is one of the worst feelings and when you find out there are so many emotions that run through your head. I also tried to explain that now that she is away from that guy; she can have a fun time in college and hang out with her friends more and meet new people. She said that she wasn't as that point yet; and I understood. I told her that it would come; without a doubt. I had been through this situation and that is was gave me empathy for her situation.",1,2,0,1,0,0,,1,,,1,1,1,7,1,4,2,4,1,2,1,6,1,3,4,3,7,2,3,5,5,7,2,2,4,4,2,4,3,3,3,2,3,1. Guilt / 2.

Eventually; he got his act together and made it into a very good university; but for a while it seemed like no colleges would accept him. Our parents would berate him and he kept comparing himself to the people he knew that would get better grades than him. I remember pitying him; because I couldn't even imagine how he was feeling. I didn't feel sympathy as much; because he got himself in the situation. I just pitied him for not coming to the realization sooner that he needed to step his game up; school-wise. I often looked down on him as someone who needed help and couldn't make things better himself. I feel like condescension is often accompanied by pity. I would constantly try to motivate him to do better in school; even getting angry at him when he wouldn't study; because he needed to take care of himself.,,I have a friend who broke up with her boyfriend of about a year; and she took it really hard. None of her friends; including me; approved of how he treated her; but she still cared deeply about him. After they broke up; I was very happy she was out of the toxic relationship; but I tried to hide my happiness and attempted to be compassionate instead. I listened to her talk about how much she missed him and gave her a shoulder to cry on. I felt sorry for her; but I didn't pity her. I just wanted her to feel better; so I put my true feelings aside in order to help her feel better.,I'm friends on Facebook with a girl I knew in high school; and she recently had a miscarriage. She posted about it on the site and seemed very saddened by it. She was looking forward to having a child; and then suddenly she didn't have the chance anymore. I didn't know this girl very well; but I did feel sympathy for her. I can't possibly ever imagine what it would feel like to lose your unborn child; I just know it would be tragic. I sent my condolences out top her; but that was all I could do.,I have a friend who auditioned for the theater school twice; and got rejected both times. In between rejections; she also didn't get cast in any of the full-length shows she auditioned for; and got nothing but small parts in the smaller shows she was in. She felt very down in the dumps; and I felt a large amount of empathy towards her. I know what it feels like to be rejected and to feel like you're not good enough. I've experienced those things; so I knew exactly how she was feeling and how to best console her. I related my experiences to hers and told her how I came out of it stronger in order to help her do the same.,1,3,0,1,0,2,,,1,,,1,1,7,1,3,7,4,2,1,5,6,2,6,7,6,4,7,7,1,2,4,4,5,4,4,3,7,7,2,2,3,4,1. disappointment / 2. annoyance / 3. ,I wouldn't call pity a type of love; I'd say that it stems from feeling love towards a person.,I feel like if you can pity someone; you also tend to feel condescending towards something.

Still; i felt compelled to help him so we gave him some change. He just said thank you with a big smile; and i felt very glad that we could help contribute to his momentary happiness. ,The other day in my English class when we were getting our graded essays back; there was one girl who got a D+ on her essay. She was so distraught because she thought she put in so much time and effort and that she was going to get a good grade. I felt bad for her because i have obviously been there at one point or another in my academic career. Everyone has. So even though I felt bad; i tried to relate to her that it isn't the end of the world and with extra credit; she should still be able to get a decent grade in the class. Even though I didn't directly feel her pain and shame in that moment; i still understood the pain because i have been there before. ,Earlier in the semester; a kid in my dorm killed himself. I din't know him and it was the first time i even heard his name. I guess I didn't even have a reason to be upset but i cried for hours thinking about the kid's family. I felt their pain so directly; as if it were my own pain. I didn't really want to to or say anything besides call my family members and tell them how much i loved them; which i did later that evening. It was only too easy to put myself in their shoes; so this is how i felt directly empathetic to them. ,1,0,1,2,1,0,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,5,1,4,3,3,5,1,2,3,2,1,6,2,6,6,4,2,2,2,7,1,5,1,4,2,5,3,6,4,5,4,1. warmth / 2. love / 3. understanding,I would probably call it sacrificial love.

3/18/14 12:42,3/18/14 13:57,144,0,0,0,0,0,0,My best friend Gabe has Chrohn's disease; and due to a lot of stress at school with teachers and work; he had to go to the hospital.  The stress had caused problems with his intestines.  We didn't think it was bad at first; but he ended up having to stay in the hospital for about six months; and having to undergo three surgeries.  I visited him as many times as I could.  I felt so bad for him; and thus I felt so much pity for him and his situation.  All I wanted was for him to get better.  I knew he was sad because he just wanted to be back at school too. ,When my best friend; Hannah; broke up with her boyfriend; I felt tenderness towards her.  She called me crying; explaining the situation.  She said they hadn't gotten into a fight; but her and her boyfriend were just not working out like she thought they would be.  They had so many similarities; but it wasn't a perfect match.  Hannah wanted to break up with him because she didn't want to be in a relationship anymore with him. Although she thought he was so perfect; she didn't want to be with him.  She was crying and trying to explain her emotions.  I was trying to understand her feelings; the entire time feeling tenderness toward her and the situation.  I never wanted to see her sad; so I went to pick her up and took her to get ice cream and talk to me to make her feel better.  I kept telling her that it wasn't her fault; and some things just aren't meant to be.  Also; I said they could hopefully stay friends and talk about the things they had in common; but now she knows that he was not the type she was looking for.,When I participated in Dance Marathon; an event in which people had to stand for 30 hours; I felt annoyed; depressed; sad; angry; and bored.  I didn't know what to do with all that time; and I was extremely exhausted.  Even though I had some of my close friends by my side; I still felt so sad and mad that I decided to participate.  I was texting my best friend; Leila; for the majority of the time; explaining to her how I felt.  She kept telling me that I should leave; and she would come pick me up if I wanted; but I felt an obligation to stay; despite how awful I was feeling.  I even broke down crying at one point; and called Leila; who told me everything was going to be okay and that I had the option to leave if I wanted to; and that if I stayed then I had the strength to do so; and the support of her and my other friends at the event.  Unexpectedly; at about 3:00AM; Leila showed up with our friend; Jake; and my favorite late night food; pizza.  The amount of happiness I felt when I saw she came; especially at that hour; was overwhelming.  And the fact that she was so thoughtful to bring me my favorite food made me feel so compassionate towards her.  She was so caring to think about me and my feelings; and I was so happy.  She made me feel so much better; and I felt that I had to complete the marathon because of what she had done for me.,One time; I was running some errands; so I missed out on my brother's basketball game.  He had really wanted me to come to the game; and my parent said he was sad that I couldn't make it.  I felt sympathetic because I had wanted to come and I knew he had wanted me to come; but I wasn't able to make it.  I was sad I couldn't go; and sad that my brother was upset I couldn't  go.,In my opinion; empathy is the understanding of another's feelings.  My friend; Ashley; failed one of the AP European History tests in high school.  I had also failed the test.  When I failed the test; I felt so awful.  I cried; and kept wondering why I didn't do better or how this could have happened if I studied so much.  I wanted to drop the class; but I also wanted to find out what I could do better in terms of study techniques for the next time.  When Ashley told me she failed the test; I knew exactly how she felt because the same thing had happened to me.  She felt sad and I was empathetic because I understood her feelings and I felt the same way.,1,4,3,0,2,1,,,,,,1,1,7,1,6,4,1,1,6,3,7,2,1,3,2,2,1,1,6,5,7,1,7,3,2,3,1,1,5,7,2,7,1. sadness / 2.  / 3. ,I think pity is feeling sad for someone else and their situation.

3/18/14 12:43,3/18/14 14:01,145,0,0,0,0,0,0,When I heard about a friend of a friends father going to jail in 7th grade I felt pity. He went to jail because he was accused of molesting children the same age as his son was at the time. I did not really know the kid and so I was unable to feel any strong attachments to him but when I put myself in his shoes I could not imagine the situation; it felt helpless. I wanted to make it better for him but I knew that was not an option I had because I was not in control in the situation; I was not even part of the situation and so I did and said nothing. ,When I was going into 11th grade and my sister left for college I was upset because it was going to be hard not having her around. Usually she doesn't shoe her emotions but I could tell that she was feeling vulnerable; scared and sad when my mom and I dropped her off. I knew she was going to be okay and that I would adjust as well but I kept thinking about how lonely I would be at home without her and it made me feel closer to her. I wanted to jump forward to a time when her being in college would no longer make me upset; and I had adjusted to the change. I drove home with my mom after dropping her off and was upset for a while and would go into her room but eventually the feeling dissipated.,Compassion is a feeling I experienced when a few years ago I saw a homeless man on the street at night who looked cold and hungry. I went into the drug store that he was sitting next to and bought him food; he was very thankful. At the time I felt bad for the man on the street even though I did not know him or his story or how he got to be in the situation he was in. I thought that maybe I could help him a little by buying him food and temporarily relieving his hunger. ,In school my friend who lives on my floor gets into these times when she becomes incapable of doing her work or cleaning her room or really doing anything productive. When this happened recently I felt bad for her because I know that it is hard for her and so I did what I could to get her out of the slump. I put on music and sat with her while she cleaned her room and tried to get her to start doing her work. However I could not relate to the situation or how she was feeling because it was not something that I had gone through personally. I don't get into slumps where I can't do my work for days like she does and so although I felt bad I was not saddened by the situation. ,When I found out my friends grandfather died I felt empathy for them. My grandpa had just died recently as well and so I understood what they were going through because I could remember how I felt when my loved one had passed away. I felt horrible because it brought back memories of how I felt when my grandpa first died and It made me upset that my friend now had to go through the same experiences I had to face. I wanted to make the pain disappear for them but I knew that was not a possibility so instead I sat with them and talked until I felt that perhaps I had alleviated their pain. ,1,4,0,2,1,3,,,,,,1,1,7,1,5,3,1,1,2,1,4,3,2,5,5,5,1,1,7,6,7,3,5,2,1,1,2,2,4,5,1,5,1. anger / 2. sadness / 3. ,I would not call pity love.

3/18/14 12:43,3/18/14 13:53,146,0,0,0,0,0,0,This past summer; my younger sister who is two years older than me had a very close friend. Her and her close friend did a lot of things together; like cheer on the same high school cheerleading team and hang out with the same group of friends.During the summer; out of no where; this said friend completely stopped talking to my sister. She refused to give my sister any explanation as to why she didn't want to be friends anymore; and was acting completely immature. My sister didn't even care to be friends with this girl anymore; but thought she deserved at least the reason as to why this girl no longer wanted to be friends. After trying to get her friend to talk to her; my sister finally gave up and decided to be the better person; because she knew she would have to deal with this girl at school and during cheer. This girl also happened to be the captain of the cheer team. She acted very immature and unfairly as a captain to a team; taking things out on my sister for no apparent reason. I felt pity for this girl; because she wasn't brought up the right away; and acted very immaturely. I am proud of my sister for how she handled this situation; and can no longer be angry at this girl for how she treated myself but instead feel pity towards her. ,When I was in high school; I started dating one of my sister's friends. He was a year older than me so he went off to college before I did. We decided to stay together during his freshman year in college and my senior year in high school. Although we broke up during a short time during this period; we got back together and were together up until the end of the summer before I went off to college for my freshman year. When I was saying goodbye to him; I felt tenderness towards him; because of the nice things he was saying towards me. Although we weren't staying together; he really told me how much I meant to him in that moment. ,,During the summer before going into my junior year of high school; my dad's best friend had committed suicide. The next morning when I found out; I lost it and couldn't control my emotions. It seemed to be a nightmare that did not actually happen. That day; we went over to his house to go visit his ex wife and his two sons. One of his sons had recently been struggling with drugs. He left his ex wife alone to deal with the situation. I felt extreme sympathy for what she had to go through; because she was also my mom's best friend and someone I had gone very close with ever since I was younger. I felt so bad for her and also for the kids. ,,1,2,0,0,1,0,,1,,1,,1,1,7,1,5,5,3,1,1,1,6,1,5,6,7,3,6,7,2,2,1,5,1,2,3,1,7,3,6,2,1,2,1. anger / 2. hostility / 3. ,I would not call pity a kind of love; because I feel like pity is more of looking down on someone.,No,5,3,3,3,7,5,3,5,5,5,3,3,1,1,1,3,2,3,2,1,5,5,6,5,2,2,1,2,1,3,2,3,1. compassion / 2. sadness / 3. ,Tenderness is the kind of love when you feel so much for that particular person in that moment in time; that every part of you loves them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,7,1,1,5,1,2,5,4,7,5,1,6,1,1,1,1,7,6,5,1,7,7,3,2,1,1,6,5,2,7,1. sadness / 2. anger / 3. ,I would call sympathy the kind of love where you love the person so much you hate to see them get hurt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was his fauly because he looked off the road and ran into the back of the car. I felt bad for him because it was a lot of money to fix his car and the other car; but at the same time it was his fault. I was thinking that it was a bad situation that I wouldn't want to be a part of; but there is no one else to blame except himself. I didn't really do much about the situation when he told me; I pretty much told him I'm sorry and that sucks. I felt there really wasn't anything I could do. ,,I felt compassion for my best friend who had just broken up with his girlfriend. They were both leaving for college and decieded to break up once they left. My best friend was heart broken and I constantly had to be there to comfort him and talk it through. I was feeling helpless because I couldn't do anything to change the situation; but I was trying to figure out what it might be like to be in his shoes and knew that he just needed support from his friends. I told him that everything was going to be okay and that he would get over her soon enough. I tried to make him realize that the world wasn't ending but overall I just had to be supportive and listen to him. I wanted to make him feel better but there wasn't anything I could do to change his mood.,,A time when I felt empathy was when one of my friends didn't get accepted into the college that she wanted to. I knew how it felt to get rejected from colleges and could put myself in her shoes; but this was very tough for her. She was crying and thought that she wouldn't go to any college. I talked to her and told her that she will get into the college where she is meant to go. When I was talking to her I was thinking that she was slightly overreacting but at the same time I realized how hard this was. No one likes rejection and I was feeling lie she just needed to hear that everything was going to be okay. I told her that I had been throuigh the same thing and it helped her. She felt comforted by the fact that she wasn't the only one this happens to. ,1,2,0,1,0,0,,,1,,1,1,1,7,1,5,2,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,7,4,2,7,7,1,1,5,5,4,5,1,2,4,5,1,1,2,2,1. Helplessness / 2. Sorrow / 3.

He often acts loudly and does not have the capacity to behave well in social situations. My friend has a very strong connection and bond with his brother; which allows all of us to feel completely normal around his brother and embrace him with all that we can. I feel pity for him when he used to come to our tennis matches in high school or even out to dinner for our team dinners. He is usually loud and can behave in a childish manner; which other people may not feel comfortable being around. I feel pity for him when I see how others react to his behaviors; mostly due to the fact that I know I cannot change the way other people think about him. I wish more people would be accepting of his actions and be more open to him.,I honestly cannot think of a specific time in which I felt tenderness toward someone. However; I associate the feeling of tenderness with a situation when I have felt for someone else and tried to do my best to make that person feel better. The feeling of tenderness; for me; comes when I care about how someone else is feeling.,My junior year of high school our varsity tennis team was playing in the New England championships against our arch rivals and my brother was the last match on with the score tied 3-3. He was the last match being played; so it was all up to him to win the championship. After he ended up winning his match; our team went on to winning the entire championship. I felt so much love and compassion for him as well as relieved that he handled the pressure the way he did.,When my twin brother and I were both around 7 years old; my brother got knocked off the diving board by a dog and hit his chin on the side of the pool. He unfortunately had to get stitches. While at the time I didn't truly know what happened because I was so young; looking back at it now I feel bad that he had to get stitches; even though it wasn't my fault or his fault. I felt sympathy for him because I didn't want him to have to go through that experience.

Refer to the sympathetic emotion response.,1) Tenderness to me relates to someone who is very unable to take care of themselves and is vulnerable to many things. A very good friend of mine; as well as an uncle; have a disease called muscular distrophy (spelling?). These two people have to be in wheelchairs from now until the end of their lives (which is a predicted 30-40 years). These two people will need constant care for the rest of their life and will always be vulnerable to things that many people are not. /  / 2) I feel a lot of sympathy; compassion; and grievance for the two friends; and wish there was more that I could do. /  / 3) I want to be able to make their diseases go away; however; I know I probably can't. I have participated in multiple fundraisers for the muscular d. campaign in hopes for better research and headway with new medications.,1) Now that I take this survey I find that compassion and sympathy are very similar. The example I had for sympathy relates to this emotion as well. I felt compassion for the family who lost their mother; and for the husband; his wife. /  / 2) I was feeling very sad and I grieved a lot. I was thinking that no one should ever have to endure a similar situation to theirs'. /  / 3) I wanted to be able to cure cancer; but I knew I couldn't. (Refer to the other response),1) A close friend of mine passed away recently. Her husband works for my dad and is how I know him and knew her. She experienced a slow death from a terrible cancer; and I saw first hand how traumatic it was for both of them; as well as their two children; who are also close friends of mine.  /  / 2) I was feeling a lot of grief and sorrow; but what I could not stop thinking about was how much worse it had to have been for their family. I realized I would never be able to feel what they were feeling unless I was in a similar situation. I wouldn't wish the experience they had on even my worst enemy and had much sympathy for their family. /  / 3) I wanted to be able to make the cancer go away even though I couldn't. My family; and my fathers companies; set up a fund for their family and tried to raise as much money as possible. I had a close talk with the father (her husband) and it was very hard to sit there and listen because there was so much pain in his voice. I said as much as I could to make him feel better but I knew nothing would make him feel better. /  ,1) Just the other day a friend of mine came up and told me how much he was worrying because he just bombed a calc 3 test. I was able to relate to the situation because in the previous semester I had bombed a calc 3 test aswell. /  / 2) When I bombed the test I was feeling very similar to him; but after time had passed I no longer felt the same way. I tried to reassure him that it would be ok and his grades would work out in the end to how he would want them to be. /  / 3) What I wanted to do was to be able to make his grade better; however; I couldn't. I told him that everything would be ok and told him that if he ever needed help studying I would be there to help.,1,0,1,2,3,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.

He was lying on the couch in the living room; where he was stationed most of the time because he couldn't get up on his own.  Whenever he wanted something; someone was always there to get it for him.  I felt kind of annoyed; because usually; when someone does something for him; it is because he is too lazy to do it himself.  However; this time was different; because was physically incapable of getting anything himself; and I felt kind of bad. /  / Later; when I was sitting next to him and my parents were upstairs; Matthew said he had to go to the bathroom.  I didn't know what to do--was I supposed to help him get up?  Was I supposed to help him go to the bathroom?  Matthew said that he could go to the bathroom himself; he just needed me to wrap his leg and help him up.  I was nervous at doing so; not wanting to hurt the brother who I deeply cared about; but I was able to put my fears aside and help him painlessly.,"When I first watched the move ""Freedom Writers;"" I felt compassion for the students.  They were shifted around from class to class so much because they were considered ""dumb"" and no one wanted to teach them; and that made me feel badly; and even a little bit angry.  I have never been in a situation like that; but I can understand what the students were feeling.  Because they weren't the most intelligent people; because no one seemed to care about them; and because of the horrible things they had to face in their home environments; the students just didn't care.  I really felt for them and wanted to help them; so I was proud to see the teacher; Erin Gruwell; really get through to the students and made them enjoy learning.  It made me want to be like Erin Gruwell and help other students in similar situations.",When I was in New York City; I saw a woman wearing a garbage back on the streets of Time Square.  She was walking around. asking for money; but no one gave any to her.  I at first felt scared; because I had never seen someone like that on the streets before; but I also felt sad.  I didn't understand why no one would help her and how she got herself into that situation.  I started to cry and told my mom how I was feeling.  I asked her why that had happened; and she told me that she didn't know; some people are just not as lucky financially as we are.  Why didn't she ask her family for help?  Well; sometimes; people's pride keeps them from accepting help from others. /  / I was only five at the time; so I didn't totally understand; thinking that everyone should have the life that I did; but now; I know that that's not the way the world works.

I am sympathetic for her about the abusive marriage because I know she did not deserve it.  But when I think about her health and near bankruptcy; I feel pity.  I believe that she had the power to prevent the weight gain; the power to obtain a college degree to get a better paying job (she dropped out of college and then my parents gave her money to take online courses later); and the power to be thriftier with money. / I don't enjoy pity because I feel a bit condescending.  I feel as though I'm judging her lifestyle and found flaws with it.  I associate pity with frustration because I think the 'victim' had the ability to prevent the situation.,,I feel compassion when I am sympathetic and also feel as though I have a vital role in caring for the person affected.  For example; a lot of my friends are very academically inclined and can easily get upset if they think they did badly on a test.  I try my best to comfort them; and I am sympathetic because I understand what situation they're in.  I wish that I could console them and just help them move on to achieve greater things.  ,"My mother is a registered nurse; and the tales of her work experiences always find a way into my family's dinner conversations.

Freak accidents; such as car crashes caused by another drunk driver; make me feel the most sympathetic.

Most people would find this offensive; but this is the most memorable and powerful compliment someone has ever given me. It sums up everything I would like to be (Beyonce) with who I actually am (awkward). I am not actually an awkward person; but I typically deviate from normal ideas and ways of doing things; and I'm not afraid of that. Everyone in my family thinks I'm a weirdo; but I just accept it. I was so moved when my little sister paid me such a high compliment. I knew that she really loved me and looked up to me; and accepted me every weird quirk that I had. I don't know if I will ever find someone else in my life who understands me as completely and well as she does.","Before spring break; I had made out with this guy at a party. I had liked him for a while but had never talked to him; and when I saw him; I summoned all my courage and went to say hi. When he had to leave with his friends; he asked me to put my phone number in his phone; so I did. The next morning he texted me with his name and a short message that said ""Have a good spring break :)"". I hadn't dated anyone; let alone talk to a guy; since last August. My boyfriend and I broke up because we were going to different colleges; and while he took one month to completely forget me and move on; I was still pretty torn up about him. I thought that this would be the perfect way to get back out into the world and find someone new. However; after spring break; I hadn't seen this new guy at all. I thought this was fine; since we were probably both busy with school; and pushed it to the back of my mind. However; after running into him a few times; I saw that the usual response was that he made a second of awkward eye contact and ran. On one of these instances; I had a friend with me. Of course; she knew all about the situation; and as the guy I liked came out of the dining hall and locked eyes with me; I casually hit her hand. She said to me ""What an asshole."" I have never felt gratitude for anyone as intensely as I did in that moment with my best friend. I knew that she truly cared about me and was angry that someone had treated me so poorly; and I will love her unconditionally until I die for having my back in that moment.",When I felt sympathy; I was hearing the story told by a friend of  mine. She had stolen prescription drugs in order to help her study more for exams. Since she had a job; a full course load; and was applying to the Ross School of Business; she decided to steal this medicine from her sister in order to make sure she had the best grades and best chance of being accepted without sacrificing her income. I know what she did was wrong; but I can't help feeling that the only thing she needed was more time in a day. She was desperate and scared and stressed out; just like many of my friends are; and I'm sad that she thought the only solution to the problem was theft and drug abuse. Since she had stolen the prescription drugs and they were in an unmarked container; my friend's roommate told their RA about the problem; who called the police. My friend was arrested and has to appear in court next August. I feel like the entire situation was extremely preventable; and that my friend didn't have to resort to such extreme measures just because of the pressure she was under. Had I known about the problem; I would have encouraged her to communicate with her professors more frequently about her grades and what she could do to improve in her classes; as well as studied with her more often.

There was this kid in middle school who would always get picked on for trying to buy his friends and for being pretty shallow. I admit during freshman year I also didnt give him the time of day. Fast forward three years to junior year. He was in chemistry class and I genuinely felt bad for the way I treated him. I sent him a facebook message explaining that what I did during freshman year was wrong and I was wondering we could make amends. His reply was along the lines of accusing me that I had a different agenda (He suggested I liked him in a romantic way). I was angry for a while; but then I thought about it for a little while. This kid has some obvious trust issues; but he will never get over them if he doesnt even take what is being handed right to him. This is where I felt pity.,"I am less aware of this emotion; but times when i experience tenderness arenr usually very personal to me. Sometimes; I search on youtube ""military homecomings"" and watch countless of videos showing families beam with joy as their loved ones come back hom from service. Without fail; I'll cry every time. I have never had that experience happen to me before (saying goodbye to a loved one for so long) and so I'm not sure why I cry every time. ","To me; compassionate means to love with forgiveness. I am often compassionate with my sister. For example; just the other day she was being pretty rude to me for no reason. She had mood swings and she would use hurtful phrases such as ""awful sister"" and ""dumb"" to address me. I am three years older than her; and although we are very close; she gets into these zones on occasion. I remember when I was 15 and I would have mood swings from day to day. That night she came to apologize;  saying she knew how she was acting but couldnt stop herself (she was either stressed or tired). I forgave her without a second thought. I guess I felt compassionate because I had been in her position before; and if I were her I would also want to be forgiven.","Again; I'll use my sister since this just happened last night. I had come back from campus and arrived at home last night 10 minutes before my sister walked in through the door from tennis tryouts. She came in quietly; so I knew tryouts hadnt gone well. I immeadiatley hugged her; as she cried on my shoulder. She had been playing tennis all year; just to get a shot at the varsity team. Having the same coach years before; I knew he was an asshole and didn't give my sister the shot she deserved. I was right. She told me as she was crying that he matched her up with the worst player; and then when their match was done (after she beat that player by a large margin); the coach made her sit out for the remainder of tryouts so other ""more likely"" varsity players could have more court time. I knew my sister tried very hard and this meant a lot to her and I felt helpless.",I differentiate sympathy as sympathy being on a more personal level; and empathy being on a less personal level. I felt empathetic when I saw the families of Flight 370 passengers crying on CNN. It actually felt as though my heart was hurting.

However; a more personal example would be about my friend ""Brad"". Brad liked/loved a girl called ""Sophie"" very much. Brad tried very hard to begin a relationship with Sophie and revealed to her that he cared for her a lot. However; she did not completely reciprocate his feelings; and instead told him that she wasn't in the place for a relationship. This culminated in Brad sending flowers on Valentines day; but then later that day he found out that she was with someone else from a friend of Sophie's. Brad told me this story and i felt a lot of pity towards him. /  / 2) I was feeling very sorry for my friend Brad and could relate to that type of situation. I was also slightly mad at Sophie; for what I saw as leading my friend on. /  / 3) I wanted to reassure Brad and tell him that everything will be okay and that there are plenty of other better women in the world; I also wanted to say what I thought about Sophie. However; I did not exactly tell him what I thought about Sophie. Instead I did reassure him; and told him there were plenty more fish in the sea.","1) One of my close friends; ""Hannah""; had recently broken up with her boyfriend and was feeling very sad about him flaunting his new found freedom through social media. Hannah was close to me and to see her so upset was very painful. /  / 2) I felt like I need to protect Hannah and reassure her; and I felt sad on her behalf.  /  / 3) I wanted to reassure her that everything would be okay; which is exactly what I did do. I told her that everything would be okay and that I was there for her.",,"1) My friend ""Andrew"" was on the track and cross country team with me and was a great long distance runner. However; Andrew had fairly serious back problems; so in his final few seasons on the track and cross country teams; he was not able to compete up to his full potential and did not achieve his goals. /  / 2) I was feeling sad for my friend; especially since his circumstance was relatable to me in many ways. /  / 3) I wanted to reassure my friend and make sure that he didn't blame himself.

3/20/14 11:09,3/20/14 11:56,158,0,0,0,0,0,0,,A time when I have shown tenderness is when I was with my grandma after she had a stroke. Normally a strong; able woman; after she had a stroke she was left feeble and unable to perform mundane tasks. The area most affected by the stroke was her ability to speak. When with her I had to take time talking; and make sure that when I was with her I talked slowly and allowed her time to process the information that I was giving her; and then be able to respond in an engaging way. During that time I felt empathy for her; and knew that I needed to put her needs above my own. This experience made me want to take more time with her and spend additional time with here knowing that another stroke could strike at anytime. ,I time I felt compassion towards someone was when I was my family. With the start of college and moving away; brought a loss of time spent with my family. Usually I would eat dinner with them; and participant in family activities during the week; and especially on the weekend. When visiting home for the first time during Thanksgiving Break; I was reunited with my family and the joy that swept over me had never been greater. We spent time together watching sports; eating dinner; and talking throughout the weekend. It felt welcoming to be home. This made me want to be home for longer; although I knew that I needed to go back to school. After break; I stayed in better contact with my family; calling home more often than I did before the Thanksgiving Break.,Today I watched a video of a young kid who was allowed to play on a professional hockey team for a day. He did not play during the game; however he was given the opportunity to skate with the team before the game; and skate out onto the ice with the team during the pregame ceremony. When announced over the loud speaker; the child became very emotional. He was given this opportunity because he has a heart condition; and regardless of the fact that he has been told to not play hockey by doctors; he continues to do so. This child became very emotional; and began to cry; during the start of the game. I was able to feel what he was feeling; and joy swept over me just as it had for the child; and almost brought tears to my own face. Although I was only watching a video; the emotions felt by the child were strongly conveyed to me and made me feel empowered to help others and give them opportunities that they might not normally have.,A time that I felt empathetic towards somebody was when I see a homeless person on the street. As I am walking by; sometime with food in my hands; I feel bad that these people live here without a home; food; and shelter. Although typically I do nothing; I feel compelled to either give them money; or provide them with a good that could help them. ,1,0,3,2,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,1,7,1,2,4,4,1,7,5,5,2,5,1,2,6,1,1,1,1,4,3,5,2,4,6,6,2,4,4,3,5,1.

3/20/14 11:29,3/20/14 11:52,159,0,0,0,0,0,0,I felt pity for my sister when she broke her arm in a playoff softball game.  She had to undergo surgery and was in a cast for 6 months. Over the course of those 6 months I drover her to doctors appointments and helped her with whatever she needed help with.  I felt pity because she wasnt able to do the things she was normally capable of doing and it was really aggravating her. ,I felt tenderness when my friends mother passed away in 10th grade. I didnt know what to say to him besides that Im sorry.  Nothing can ease that pain or make it go away.  It was a really tough time for my whole friend group and we did everything we could to comfort my friend Brett. I felt sad and helpless because there was nothing I could do to make my friend feel better. ,As I reflect upon these circumstances more I have come to conclude that tenderness and compassion are the same thing to me.  In circumstances; like the passing of my friend's mother; I felt compassion and tenderness as one. ,I felt sympathy for my mother when she was rushing to get to my brother's basketball game and she was rear-ended by a person talking on their cell phone.  She was so upset that she wasnt able to make it to his final game of the season. I felt sympathetic for her because the ability to get their was taken out of her hands;and she felt bad she wasnt there to support her son. ,,1,3,1,0,2,0,,,,1,,1,1,7,1,7,3,7,1,3,6,6,6,1,2,1,4,1,1,4,2,6,4,6,5,6,5,1,2,6,5,6,6,1. empathy / 2. sympathy / 3. caring,no,no,1,1,7,1,4,6,1,1,7,5,7,6,1,1,1,7,1,1,1,1,7,2,7,4,6,7,1,1,6,6,3,7,1. sad / 2. depressed / 3. ,a caring sort of love,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1. tenderness / 2. sadness / 3. ,,1,1,7,1,7,1,1,1,1,7,7,6,1,7,1,2,1,1,7,7,2,6,6,6,3,5,6,2,4,5,2,6,1. empathy / 2. pity / 3. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3/20/14 11:09,3/20/14 12:16,159,0,0,0,0,0,0,Something that had happened that intentionally done but something that turned out to be bad was when i pitied someone. My feelings and thoughts were more so on the fact that my friend did something stupid and that  i thought of her in a different way than i had before as if I sort of looked down upon her; this is what i felt on the inside. But on the outside; I didn't show this expression. I just simply smiled and listened to her as she told me her story about how she felt like she was used by a guy. Right the; I just wanted to tell her I told you so; and that she is kind of stupid for not listening to her friends. But i kept it cool because it would have been very rude; and she already had a lot of emotion. So i simply told her that it was going to be alright and that she should move on with her life. ,I felt tenderness when I was with family friend. The other family had two children age 4 and 6. They were cute little girls who were extremely cute and smart both physically and in their personality. I loved them and loved hangout with them because they made me very happy. I just wanted to hug them and give them presents. Whenever our families were together; I would take care of them and play with them as if i was their real brother. ,I felt compassion to my mom when I went to college. Living in my household; we never really expressed our love for one another orally. We never really told each other that we loved each other but inside; we all knew that we all loved each other very dearly. When I moved to college; while adjusting to not living with my mother and the new college life; I realize how grateful I was to have my mother. And I felt a lot of compassion toward my mother. I realized all the small things that she had done for me that I had not realized before or had taken for granted. Right at the moment; I texted her and told her that I loved her. This was a very rare occasion. Out of surprised; my mother asked me if something was wrong. And I simply replied that I was so grateful to have her as my mom. I felt love and a longing towards my mom. I wanted to give back to her because she had given me so much. ,I felt sympathy for my friend when he was telling me that his parents were going through a tough time. Although every married couple usually goes through hard times; my parents seemed to make it out of it. And although I was never really exposed to a divorce situation in my life; I just knew that my friend was having a hard time and he needed a friend to talk to. Over all; I was understand his point of view because I feel like as human beings; we can understand and feel what other people are feeling as if that specific thing is happening to themselves. I just listened to my friend and told him that everything would be okay at the end. Although he hated his parents for getting a divorce; I told him that there might be things that he wouldn't understand so he should try to keep an open mind.,I met a girl in England and she was telling me about her views of the world and how the world doesn't seem to be too nice. She didn't seem to think that there were that many good things in this world; or at least we couldn't see the goodness in the world because we are usually blinded by our society. I felt empathy toward her because I felt the same way. I understood her because I have experienced similar things as her. I didn't really say anything but nod my head in agreement. She said she felt comfortable talking to me about this topic. At the end when she finished; however; I told her that the world is truly a good place and that we must try harder to look at the positives than the negatives. ,1,4,1,3,0,2,,,,,,1,2,5,1,4,5,2,1,2,2,3,1,6,6,6,6,5,6,4,4,6,4,2,4,1,2,7,7,1,1,7,4,1.

I feel compassionate towards these people because I have had loved ones who have gone through the same thing so there is a mutual understanding.

I knew that she was going to die soon and that there was nothing that I could do so I just wanted to keep her company.

They were identical twins and only 7 years old. Their dad was a dentist in East Lansing and their mother worked as a veterenarian at MSU. A recent string of incidents involving my uncle had lead to the two discussing divorce. My uncle is an alcoholic (now recovering; thankfully). He would get drunk around his kids and occassionally offer to drive impaired. His decisions did not go unnoticed my aunt. While the rest of my family tried desperately to get my uncle counseling and avoid the divorce; it still happened. My cousins were devastated. The traveling between houses they had to endure for the rest of their childhood years now stood as a barrier between their equivalent love for both parents. To be clear; although my uncle was an alcoholic; I deeply loved and respected him. Most of his drunken antics were not when I was at the house. He was often funny anyways and I couldn't even tell the difference between him when he was drunk or not. I loved my aunt as well. She was a very caring woman that just wanted the best for her children; given the circumstances. I felt compassion for my cousins. I told them constantly that their parents made the decision with them in mind. Despite my uncle's problem; I told my cousins that both of their parents loved them very much. After the initial year of the break up; I made sure to visit my cousins as often as possible. I didn't offer them their pity; I just tried to be a nice cousin for them. My own mother sent me over with cookies and sometimes video games for their PS2. Together; we could spend an afternoon eating cookies and playing video games or watching a movie. Whatever we did; it always shifted the focus from the divorce. Instead; our times together focused on the great times we as cousins always had together. I always was careful not to approach the sore subject. I might aks how they were feeling overall; but there was no need to interview them about what they felt about the divorce. I just wanted to be there to distract them from this horrible; life changing event. Of course; it was probably easier to distract 7 year olds than if they had been older (at least old enough to understand the gravity). I felt terrible for both of them and realized that their lives would be made more difficult now that they had 2 houses to go between. Because of these stresses; I always tried to be there to help them. I tried to be somebody outside of the problem; but someone able to guide them through a tough time.,I felt sympathy towards someone my fellow friend had gotten fired from umpiring. A particularly unusual situation had come up for him in the middle of the game while him and I were working for some of the angriest managers in the 12 year old league. As a result of this unusual play; my friend who worked behind home plate was subjected to the ire of the visiting manager. Because only theh ome manager reports to the league about the quality of the umpires; we usually disregarded the visiting manager. This; however; was probably the third time my friend had been singled out by this particular manager. Fianlly; my friend erupted on this guy and gave him the middle finger. I laughed silently because of the audacity of this 15 year old flipping off an adult. The visiting manager took down my friend's name and soon the league made its decision to fire him. I felt really bad fro my friend because he was a good umpire who just had a bad day on the field. It happens to me occassionally as well. He just had a bad string of calls that caught him in a bad mood with the wrong managers. It was just a bad situation overall to have landed in. I saw him the next day in school and said the same to him. It really could've happened to anybody. Us 15 year olds didn't even know what had happened in that play. Unfortunately; my friend had to take the heat. I told him I felt sorry and that I understand that he might be pissed or remorseful about his actions from yesterday. ,,1,2,1,0,1,0,,,1,1,,1,1,4,1,7,2,1,1,4,2,5,3,6,2,6,3,2,2,2,2,1,7,3,1,3,4,7,7,1,3,2,1,1.

3/21/14 10:00,3/21/14 10:45,165,0,0,0,0,0,0,,I felt tenderness for my girlfriend when she told me both her grandmas are not doing so well with their health and that they are both projected to die in a short time. I felt tenderness toward her and felt like I had to console her. The worst part was that I knew I or anyone else couldn't do anything fix the situation. It was how it was; because that is life. But I did console her and felt tenderness towards her. ,I felt compassion towards my other friend who goes to Michigan State. His girlfriend that he had been dating for 4 years; who is also my friend; goes to Uof M. When they had to be away from each other because of college it led to the girlfriend cheating on him almost every week. I felt compassionate towards my friend at State because he had no idea what his girlfriend was doing. I felt sick to my stomach that the girlfriend could cheat like that and be stabbing someone in the back while doing it. I took matters into my own hands and talked to the girlfriend. She had to tell her boyfrind and it would have to be up to him what to decide. Eventually they broke up. I felt terrible though for my friend at State that this was the way his relationship with his 4 year girlfriend ended. ,"My roomate and my other friend are both walkons for the football team here at UofM. They both live in Bursley and have to get up at very early hours in the morning to go to practice. My roomate was smart enough to find a way to get to the practice in the morning as soon as he heard that he made the team because the Michigan buses do not run that early in the morning. The other friend procrastinated this and then was left to rely on my roomate for a ride every morning to practice or workouts since my roomate now had a car. The friend had a car but it was at home which he conveniently ""forgot"" to bring back to UofM every time he went home. He relied on my roomate everyday to drive him and never offered to pay for gas. I told my roomate that he was being taken advantage of by his friend and that he should definitely say something to him so that he brings his car up from home. My roomate did; but the friend just conveniently ""forgot"" to purchase any parking passes. Their workouts in the morning started to begin at different times and my roomate was having to get up earlier just so he could drive his friend to his workout when my roomate could have been sleeping. I felt so sympathetic to my roomate and wished I could have spoken to the friend; but I knew it wasn't my place to do so. I knew my roomate needed his sleep and he was having to get up very early everyday even if his workout started much later in the day. Finally; my roomate had enough and told his friend he needed to figure out his car situation by the end of the week bc he will not be driving him anymore. I felt better about the situation and was glad my roomate finally stuck up for himself. He understood that he was just being taken advantage of and that was not right.

3/21/14 10:32,3/21/14 11:33,166,0,0,0,0,0,0,During practice the other day; we were doing a possession drill in a tight space. It was 4 against 2 in a 7 by 7 area. The object of the drill was to try and get 15 passes against the 2 defenders. The loser after 2 minutes or 15 passes would have to do 10 push-ups and 10 sit-ups. While playing; I felt pity for one of the defenders; because every time he came near me for about 4 passes in a row; I embarassed him by playing the ball through his legs. He was getting so angry that by the 4 time he kicked the ball away in fury. I felt pity because he was trying so hard; but he just couldn't get the ball from me; and that in turn; spurred his anger and got annoying to me. I felt pity for a certain amount of time and then it faded because he got even more aggressive than he already is; and I couldn't tolerate him.,,"At an away game during the season; at halftime; I felt compassion when receving instructions from coach in the lockeroom. I felt the compassion from his voice during the halftime speech to get us motivated; and began to do much of the same thing as him when we took the field again in the second half. Rallying people on; showing how much emotion I was putting on myself to express to my teammates how much the game actually mattered. I was just feeling a lot of energy; like a spark that was trying to lift the teammates around me to rally for a crucial win. I wanted to work really hard; show everyone that I was trying my best for the team and taking no plays off. I was tackling people hard; I was sharp in my passing; I was defending; I was sprinting my tail off. I just said things like ""let's go boys"" or ""the goals coming keep working"" and stuff like that. Mostly motivational stuff. But I'm sure my teammates could feel the compassion for the situation that I had and was exerting throughout the the second half and most of the entire time I was in the game.",I felt sympathy for my roommate one day after training when he had gotten hurt severely. It was his first two weeks back after being out for 6 months with hip surgery. He hadn't played in over 2 years; and was doing everything in his power to get back and playing again. He finally was cleared to play full-contact for the first time in two years. We were doing a drill where it was 8 v 8 in a small area to goal. He was defending his man and the ball skip passed him in the air. He jump up with another one of our players and landed awkwardly; dislocating his hip again. He was in so much agony; after working so hard and doing so much he would now be out another 6-8 months to regain strength in his hip again to start practicing. I just felt really bad; it was a freak incident; and no one could really control that or even foresee it happening. I kept telling him you'll be fine; it'll get better; and tried to motivate him. At some point I just gave up because all he would rely on for healing were alcohol and pain meds. It sounds kind of extreme; but after persistence he finally got over it; got himself back together both on the field and in the classroom. By taking the right steps; he finally is practicing again and I'm really proud of him. I just felt so extremely bad for him when it first happened because he put in so much work to get back playing and it just set him back even further.,,1,1,0,0,0,2,,,1,1,,6,6,1,6,4,4,6,5,1,5,1,1,5,5,6,6,6,5,5,5,4,3,7,4,1,1,1,5,2,2,4,4,1.

I never really talked about the situation with my friend because at this point we weren't talking too much anymore. One of the last times I had really talked to him he had gotten sent away to a bording school for all the times he had gotten in trouble.  I felt bad for him; i knew this was going to severely hurt his future and chances in life but i also knew that this event was his fault; not that i like to asign blame when a child is being born but this event could have been avoided.  I felt bad for him but i was not sympathizing with him.,,A time I remember feeling compassion for someone else was when a good friend of mine passed away and I had to talk to his mother.  I felt a mutlitude of emotions at this time but one of them was definitely compassion; this was because she was now a mother who had no children. She is an amazing woman who I consider close to a second mom but she was going through something so difficult that i could hardly comprehend.  What I was feeling was that I knew she was in a lot of pain because she had just gone through one of the most painful experiences possible; and although I was certainly in pain I knew that she was taking it even harder and I just wanted to try and lessen the amount of pain/anguish she was feeling.  When we talked; we talked a lot about religion and belief honestly she was helping me through the experience more than I was her because it's just her nature to help me when I am in pain.  The best way I could describe how i was feeling compassion at this point in time was I saw her pain and i fully registered where and why it was occuring and i truly felt for her; i understood exactly why this was so difficult for her.,A time i felt sympathy for someone was when my dad had retired from his job as a tax lawyer to pursue a career as a highschool history teacher.  He had always loved teaching and history but he didn't ever expect how difficult it was going to be for him to get a job in the busy teacher market that is norther virginia.  I felt sympathy for him when he had to take a job teaching entrepeneurship; keyboarding and introduction to Office. This was not what he wanted to do with is time and I genuinely felt bad for him; he was in a very bad situation because he had committed too much time to try and be a teacher so he had to accept this job.  I didn't do too much I never really mentioned that he was being forced to do a job he wasn't particularly in love with.

Some people from the school noticed that and would avoid him and there were a lot of jokes about him. Eventually it got to the point that everyone knew who Anthony Lee was; and more specifically to stay away from him. He was wierd and tried to hard they said. One day my friend accidentally met him in a rite aid and they talked and she though he was acutally really nice; but then I guess he was so attention starved that he started coming on too strong. He friended her on Facebook; asked repeatedly for her phone number (I doubt he was actually interested; I think he just wanted a friend) and he kept badgering her to hang out.  / She was so uncomfortable that she started to avoid him at all costs and it only served to perpetuate the image he already had. I pitied him because he was likely being picked on and no one really wanted to talk to him; but I didn't exactly empathize with him because he brought it on himself with being extremely clingy to people who showed even the slightest kindness.  / It was sad that he had to deal with a crappy high school experience; but I wasn't inclinded to do anything about it. ,My best friend had passed out after drinking too much and I was terrified for her; but after she recovered a little; she was still really sick and I sat next to her and cared for her until she fell asleep. Just  having her there and needing to take of her carefully while she was sick made me feel tenderness towards her.  / I cleaned her up; helped her get comfortable; made sure she was okay; grabbed water and tylenol; grabbed her a blanket; and set her phone by her.

3/26/14 9:57,3/26/14 10:49,172,0,0,0,0,0,0,,Tenderness is an interesting emotion as it can go along with a number of other emotions. One event in which I felt tenderness toward someone else was when my friend believed that all of her other friends didn't like her. There had been a number of events leading up to this situation; but at one point during our Freshman year my friend told me that she thought that most of her friends didn't actually like her; and that they just tolerated her because they lived in the same hall as her. I asked her why she felt this way; and she explained that it was because some of her friends had been getting annoyed with her over stupid little things. At the time; I did not fully understand why she felt this way; but I understood that she was upset about it and that I should try and make her feel better about the situation. I explained to her that just because people were getting annoyed with her over little things didn't mean they disliked her and that in order to really find out what was wrong she needed to confront the people that she felt were annoyed with her directly. Though I could not understand my friend's situation completely; I did feel tenderness toward her. ,When I think of compassion I think of that feeling you get when you're watching the ASPCA commercials with Sarah McLauchlin. That feeling I get when I both feel for someone or something and am passionate about their plight. One instance in which I felt this emotion was in my senior year of High School. My friend had been cast in the school's play as a minor role; but it was her first ever speaking role and she was super excited about it because she wanted to get over her stage-fright. One day in rehearsal our director announced that her role had been recast. It was such a small role; three lines at most; one scene on stage; the rest of the show she was in the ensemble; so to most people it wouldn't matter that those three lines had been given to someone else; but you could see on her face that she was upset. She had wanted to prove that she could do it. That she could get out on that stage and sing those three lines just like anyone else could; and it had been taken away from her. I both felt that feeling; that desire to do well; to conquer your fear; and was impassioned by it. How dare her take away the role he had given her; how dare he take away this one chance for her to prove herself. So I stood up and said that. I told him off for taking this chance away from her and I walked out of the theater. She ended up with two speaking roles in two different scenes. ,One time in which I felt sympathy for someone was when they got a low grade on a test. For the longest time I had been the biggest overachiever and would do everything I possibly could to get good grades. I both understood and was able to feel what it was like to get a poor grade on something that I thought I had or needed to do well on. My friend got a failing grade on her Econ midterm and was nearly distraught over the fact. I truly understood what it was like to do that badly; as the year before I had also gotten a failing grade; so I explained to her that it wasn't the end of the world; that I understood exactly how she felt; and that by the end of the year I had still been able to pass the class. ,One experience in which I felt empathy toward someone was when they were feeling lonely because they were not in a relationship. My friend is straight; and has never had a relationship with anyone and though I do not feel the same way they do about the opposite sex; or even relationships in general; I can understand what it is like to be alone. I felt bad for them; I told them that I was sure that they would be fine and that there was someone out there for them. But there wasn't really anything more I could do. I understood their feelings; but I had no solution. ,1,4,0,3,2,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,5,1,3,3,2,1,4,6,4,2,1,1,1,5,1,1,1,1,3,2,4,1,4,4,6,6,1,1,2,4,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,I would not call tenderness a kind of love. ,1,1,7,1,2,3,5,1,1,7,7,6,1,7,1,6,1,1,7,7,6,1,7,3,7,2,4,2,4,2,3,7,1.

She was very drunk and lost her phone and her friend got sick. She was a complete mess and i felt very bad for her and i felt sympathy toward her. I was sad and put myself in her shoes which resulted in me feeling bad. I thought that she was going to be upset for a long time. I just told her that everything was fine and that  we will find her phone tomorrow.,I felt empathy towards my friend when his dog passed away. The fact that he was really sad made me feel very sad and it was hard to see him like that. I wanted to talk to him but it was difficult with the struggle that he was going through.

3/26/14 9:57,3/26/14 10:32,174,0,0,0,0,0,0,One time; a friend of mine came to me to get my help on their relationship problems. They were really sad because they had argued with their boyfriend and were not sure whether or not they could still be together after the argument and the distance the two had between them. I felt pity for her because I saw how sad the situation made her which made me feel bad for as well. What I was debating at the time was whether or not it was my position as a good friend to tell her how to deal with her relationship specifically; or to give her more general advice based on my previous experiences. I felt conflicted here because I was friends with both the girl asking for advice and her boyfriend as well and we talked daily so I felt that if I did anything to make a significant impact in their relationship I would feel guilty about it afterward. /  / What I wanted to do was help them mend their relationship so that we could continue to hangout as a group of friends like we have been doing since high school.  /  / What I ended up doing was advising her to do whatever she felt most comfortable with. I knew that she was feeling more and more sad recently because of the distance between her and her boyfriend so although it would be a sad thing for her if she would break up with him; it would be better in the long term for everyone if they did not have to feel tied down or obligated to be going out anymore. I told her what I described beforehand and she agreed with me and ended up resolving the issue with her boyfriend later thanks to my advice. ,,1. One time; my little brother was crying in his room due to being scolded and yelled at by my parents because of his poor performance in school. They punished him harshly and grounded him as well as not listening to his reasoning for the poor showing; as such I felt compassion towards him because I felt bad looking at how distressed and hopeless he looked. I was thinking that I could cheer him up and help him do better next time on his schoolwork seeing as how I had already gone through the same thing 5 years beforehand.  /  / What I ended up doing was telling him that I would help him improve and listen to his problems because I knew that my parents would never listen to the reasons so at the very least I could offer an ear for him. He ended up taking my offer and felt much better afterward because he had someone who could watch out for him if he needed help. ,One time I felt sympathy towards my little brother when he was dealing with his first week of middle school track. I felt a little happy at the time that someone else could experience what I did in middle school and I was thinking at the time that I kind of feel bad for him but at least my parents would finally believe me when I said that track was pretty tough at first. What I wanted to do was to give him advice on how to get better at track (attend practice; stretch; train at home) as well as telling my parents that I was not kidding about how tough it was at first because they did not believe me as I was the oldest sibling and they thought I was making an excuse for not liking track. What I ended up doing was telling my little brother the advice that I had listed beforehand but I did not tell my parents though they eventually found out; but to my chagrin did not even acknowledge that they had been harsh with me but compassionate towards my little brother's same situation. ,,1,0,1,0,1,2,,,1,1,,1,2,1,1,4,3,3,2,4,5,2,5,1,6,1,5,2,1,6,6,5,2,4,3,5,5,3,2,1,2,4,4,1.

It is kind of like the kind of love someone would give to a cute little animal in the sense that you feel that it how less power over its situation and that you can in some way influence and help it out. ,I don't think this is true because I believe that contempt is only utilized to express disgust or a sort of hatred towards something based on their situation while pity is showing more compassion toward the subject. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,3,1,2,5,3,1,1,5,5,6,1,7,1,6,3,2,6,5,4,4,3,1,4,4,3,3,3,2,4,3,1.

My Junior year of high school; I volunteered for a day at a senior center in the heart of Detroit.  The building was very old and was in desperate need of repair.  All of the people who went there were elderly; and most of them were also very poor.  Some could not walk on their own and needed wheel chairs.  Some said that they lived alone; and had no one to care for them.  For many people; their family did not ever reach out to them or visit them.  There were a lot of seniors who were very lonely; and desperatley in need of love and human interaction.  I felt so bad for them; and wanted them all to know how special they were.  I just wanted to tell every one of them that I loved them.  They were all so sweet; and all so in need of human love.  I tried my best to convey by my word and actions that they were special and loved.,My dad has had knee problems for as long as I can remember.  His pain eventually got to the point where it was affecting his walkig; which was affecting how he walked.  Because of this; he had to get total knee replacement.  He was very optimistic going into the surgery; and although it went well he took a long time to recover.  He was in a lot of pain for months after the surgery.  He had trouble sleeping; and eventually had to be medicated in order to sleep at night.  He limped when he walked; and could not kneel in church or make any sudden movements with his knee.  I felt so bad for him.  He has always been very active and constantly on the move.  He has never been one to sit still or lay around.  He had a difficult time recovering; and it was a long and painful time for him.  I wanted to make him feel better; but I knew there was no way that I could do that.  I was constantly reassuring him that everything would be ok; but I felt somewhat powerless.,Just this morning; my friend who lives in my hall came to me and told me she was sick.  She looked miserable; and she said she ahdn't slept at all last night.  Her skin felt very hot even though she said she was cold.  She told me she had an awful headache as well.  After describing to me how she felt; I realized that it sounded liek the same thing I had just last week.  I was so sick the week before; seeminlgy with the same illness; that I had to go home.  I missed a lot of important things (exams; volunteer work) but I was so sick that I could not get out of bed.  When she told me how she was feeling; I knew exactly how that felt.  I wanted to badly to help her feel better; but I knew that there was nothing I could really do.  I comforted her and told her to go see a doctor; but I felt bad becasue I wanted to do something more to help her.  I know how  awfulbeing sick like that feels; and I would not wish it upon anyone.,1,0,1,2,1,0,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,1,7,1,2,5,3,1,1,5,3,1,2,4,2,7,1,1,4,4,7,2,7,2,4,7,2,2,7,7,2,7,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,Compassion is definitely a kind of love.

I thought about how difficult his life must be compared to everyone else. I did nothing. I wanted to make him feel welcome and a part of society but I didn't know how. Instead I think I just made him uncomfortable. ,When I was watching a funny video about a little girl and her mother teaching her to say no to strangers. I was thinking she was so innocent and cute.

I was mad so I said mean things back. I wanted to punch him in the face but I just said mean things in return and asked him to never talk to me again. I felt sad and hurt but at the same time i was angry and i also thought it was sort of comical because clearly he is just a sad person.,When my best friends boyfriend broke up with her after a year and a half of dating; i had to be very tender with all of my words and what I would say and do. I did not want to say something that would upset or hurt her and I had to make sure that my words were never harsh but always understanding. Hugs helped us get through a lot of hard times and just showing a little extra love and kindness.,When I met my little would be one of the best times that I showed compassion for someone. Tara is my pride and joy in my life right now and I have this feeling of just utmost respect; love; endearment; and adoration. I know about the things she is going through with boys and with school and I do my best to be able to help her with it all. When i found out about her dating a guy much older than her i felt compassion because I knew what she was going through. I wanted to tell her how bad of an idea it was and how I just want to protect her and be  there for her and I couldnt do that if she wouldn't let me. It is important to me to be there for her and love her but I disagreed with what she was doing.,There was recently a house fire in my home. It was sad  and devastating and three girls lost all of their belongings. I felt so sad for them and I had no idea what to say or do. I was so happy that they were okay but I know that means nothing to them. Stuff is hard to lose especially when you have a connection with that stuff. so seeing them in pain and hurting caused me to hurt and feel pain as well. I was sad for them and I felt bad for them and I did not know what to do in that situation.,My roommate Maria told us that her mom was a binge drinker. I knew what she was going through and I knew how to help her try and handle things. She did not want to listen to me at all but I still knew what she was going through. i hated that she wouldn't listen to me and that she did not want to take my help.

3/26/14 10:52,3/26/14 11:55,178,0,0,0,0,0,0,I felt pity for my friend in a way I felt sorry for the situation he was in. In high school; he did not do his school work often as he had more dire needs to consider; he was thinking of how to acquire food and money for things he wanted. School was in the back burner. Since he struggled to find good food and was often hungry; a situation I have never been in and though of since food has always been available to me; I felt pity for him. I felt bad and sorry for him. I wanted to help him in the best way I can and I often asked him if he wanted my help or wanted any food. I bought him a doughnut before because I felt pity for him.  ,Tenderness is a word I would describe how I feel towards my family relatives such as my mother and brother. No matter what happens; I will always love my family and would do my up most to help and support them in time of need; but there is no sexual desire from this love. It is similar to the feeling of being on a committed team or a best friend kind of bond. I wanted to protect and support them and expected the same in return. I helped out with errands; spent time with them; and hugged them. I continually asked about their days since I was curious and shared stories to have a good conversation. ,I felt compassion for a friend I really liked. She was smart; beautiful; and kind. Since she helped me so much and spent a long time together during the day; I had feelings for her in which I believe is similar to the term of compassion. I wanted to help her in anyway I can whether it is helping out with errands or consulting. I wanted her to be happy and though often how best can I make her smile and have a good time. For me; I wanted to spend time with her; we played many board games and card games; we watched movies; we did homework and studied together; we had lunch and dinner together; and we mostly talked. I asked her what she looked forward to in the future and what she liked. We mostly shared our past experiences about our own family; mostly humorous stories. ,,,1,2,0,1,1,2,,,,1,1,1,1,6,1,4,3,6,1,5,3,5,1,6,6,5,2,2,3,6,6,5,5,2,5,5,2,5,4,4,4,4,5,1. sorry / 2. bad / 3. sorrow,Not a kind of love.,true; to feel pity; you have to have some sort of connection or feeling towards them. ,6,3,1,2,1,7,5,3,6,6,1,6,2,1,3,5,5,5,5,1,2,5,5,5,6,6,4,5,2,3,5,6,1. respect / 2. kindness / 3. love,It would be in the form of loving a family member. ,5,6,2,5,3,6,6,5,4,7,3,5,1,2,1,5,4,4,3,3,3,5,4,7,6,6,3,6,2,2,6,5,1. love / 2. passion / 3. happiness,It would be a serious form of love.

For whatever reasons; they had chosen to very selfishly start doing everything for themselves. There was always an underlying motive for whatever it was they were doing; and it wasn't out of friendship for me; or anyone else. / While at first upset; I then felt pity because obviously once everyone discovered how selfish that person had become; no one wanted anything to do with them. Even though I was hurt by the situation; I more felt sorry for them then anything; regardless if it was there fault. I could not relate to why they were doing what they were doing or what exactly they were feeling; I just knew it wasn't good and that I felt helpless to give any kind of support. / My pity turned into a kind of servitude toward them; with me thinking of it as a friendship when it was truly only me helping them with whatever it was they needed help with. I was their only person to go to; not friend; and the only time they came to me was for help. I wanted to think of myself as a friend to them; and I hoped that they were my friend too. But I was lying to myself because of the pity I felt toward them. I would often tell myself I wouldn't help them anymore if they continued to make decisions that would be considered selfish and childish. But I didn't have it in me to leave them all alone and up until  recently; continued to sacrifice for them at the expense of just about everything else; regardless of how much I ended up resenting it.,,I felt compassion for my brother when he was making mistakes in his life that seemed to be out of anyone's control. While he made these mistakes; there was this rooted feeling of caring for him; regardless of how badly he would screw up. While I was upset with him; it was always overrode with compassion and just wanting things to be better for him. My parents and I (being his older brother); did our very best to give him advice to perhaps shed some light to him on what he was doing that was so wrong and why. His continued mistakes seemed to never end; and like most of us; they  never will. However; I now feel looking back that it was our compassion for him that has dulled the severity of his mistakes and have gotten him to see what he has done so that he does not make the same mistakes again. / I was upset; annoyed and hurt by what my brother was doing to me and my family through lying. I felt he was being very selfish and unreasonable and at times; felt like giving up on him in a way. Yet the persistence of my family and I; I felt; were what truly made a difference.,I felt sympathy for a friend who was going through a little bit of a down slide in terms of just not feeling very happy. He was for one reason or another; just not seeing the brighter side to things and I knew that feeling very well. I thought that this was something he could pull himself out of only with the help with people that cared about him; as that's the way that I know  how to best help myself when I go through periods of feeling sad. / I wanted to do all that I could to make him the jovial and happy friend he is 99% of the time. Yet the other side of me again knew that this was something I could only help him with; not help him out of. I tried my best to always reassure him that it was just a rough stage that we would get him out of; we as in me and his other friends and family; which we did.,,1,0,1,0,1,2,,,1,1,,3,1,7,4,6,3,3,3,3,7,5,7,1,4,1,7,3,3,5,4,3,5,6,2,7,7,5,1,3,1,4,4,1.

3/26/14 10:54,3/26/14 11:53,181,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Last week; I volunteered at a food bank in Ypsilanti with my friend. There; we organized foods by category and put them on different shelves. While we were moving cans from one shelve to another; I saw a couple of people come in. The first one I saw was a middle aged lady. The supervisor showed her around and told her that; since she had a household of 3; she was allowed this many cans of this; this many boxes of that; etc. At one point; she asked if she could have five boxes of a certain kind and the supervisor harshly said ""No"". I pitied that woman so very much. She seemed  very poor; a bit disheveled and avoided our eyes at all cost. I think she must have felt uncomfortable and uneasy; or maybe she thought we were judging her situation. I felt so sad at the idea that this woman does not have enough food to feed her family; while we waste so much food at the university dining halls witout remorse. I felt a sense of unfairness in this world; that some people get to have so many luxuries that they don't need; while others have barely enough to get by. I pitied her so much; but I couldn't do much for her; and reassured myself that by voulunteering at this food bank; I was helping her live a better life. ",I remember my aunt once had a very bad day at work and came back home really sad and started crying and told me about what happened and how she was badly treated by her supervisor. I felt really bad for her and tried to make her feel better by gently talking thing through and hugging her when she was about to cry. I felt very close to her and had a heartbreak at the idea that anyone could treat such a nice person in such a bad way. ,,Once; my best friend called me and started complaining about how she is unable to trust anyone and how she feels like everything and everyone; including her family is fake; and will one day betray her. She had had really bad memories of staying over at her grandmother's and never wanted to speak to her again. I sympathized with her situation; although I had never really felt the exact same thing; I had once had the feeling of hating everyone and everything for other reasons. ,Once I went to eat dinner with my friend. She started complaining about how college life is so difficult and how difficult it is for her to manage all the coursework while maintaining a healthy social life. I told her I felt the same way; that I was going through the same trouble; the same problems; and the same dilemmas. We complained together over some other related things; and I felt really close to her because we were living the same problems and shared a lot more than we thoguht. It also made me feel better about myself because I knew I was not the only one struggling with life!,1,0,0,2,1,3,,1,,,,1,1,7,3,1,6,3,3,2,3,6,5,7,7,2,7,1,1,7,6,7,1,6,3,6,5,3,5,7,7,2,6,1.

3/26/14 10:55,3/26/14 12:44,182,0,0,0,0,0,0,Here in Ann Arbor; I always see a homeless man sitting in the same spot over by the new Walgreens; and every time I walked past him he is holding up a sign for money. When I walk past him I feel pity for him; I feel bad for him. I know then that when I walk by I should give him some money; but I have been told that some people pretend to be homeless and make lots of money. I guess that's me being a pessimist but it's how I think. I take pity on the man when I walk by him because I wouldn't want to be in his shoes. I wouldn't want to have to sit on the street and ask college kids to give me money. I can only imagine how his pride hurts when he sits on the sidewalk. Some of these kids are extremely rich; from wealthy families all over the country; yet they have this pompous attitude that everyone is beneath them and they don't feel like they should help anyone out. It's like when I walk past the man; I want to ask him how he is doing and how he got to where he is today. It's sad that he always keeps his head down when I have walked past him. I'm not saying that he never looks up and makes eye contact with pedestrians; but I haven't seen it. It's got to be almost demeaning. I'm sure this man was successful at some point in his life; yet for some circumstances; he now sits on the street over by Walgreens and asks for money. ,When I think of the word tenderness; I feel as though it means taking care of someone. Not necessarily taking care of someone but making sure they are ok and you see them through their circumstances. A time when I felt tenderness towards someone was when one of my teammates tore his ACL playing soccer. It was during a big tournament down in Dallas of spring break of my junior year in high school. This was the ideal time for players of my age; 16-17 year olds; to be scouted and recruited by college coaches. This tournament was one of the biggest of the year and practically all Division 1 college coaches would be in attendance at some point. My friend; who I won't name out of respect; wanted to play D1 soccer more than anything else. It was his dream to play D1 soccer. I had grown up playing with him since the age of 9 and we had become really close. However; his injury happened during our second game of the tournament. We were playing a team from LA and they were one of the best in the country. They were quick; fast; efficient; and hard working. The day was blistering hot and the game was at 2 pm. The field conditions were hard and choppy since it had not rained in a while. My friend was in much better shape than I am but even he was gassed. In the second half he was running back to try and stop a break away and stepped in a divot and twisted his knee and fell to the ground. He was in agony. We had to lift him off the field after the play stopped and I felt a sense of tenderness towards him. I wanted to make sure he was ok and see him through his injury. ,My grandpa recently just had surgery on his neck to alleviate pressure off his spine and to increase the blood circulation throughout his body. I went home and visited him before spring break this year and he was not doing well. His neck was in a brace; he was very loopy; he didn't each much; and he was in a lot of pain. My grandma was doing the best should could under the situation. I could tell that she was under lots of stress; from the doctors; my grandpa; and other family members. She was exhausted; yet she acted like she had just gotten back from a vacation or something. She was completely relaxed and at ease and wanted to know how I had been; not the other way around. I felt compassion towards her. I felt a bond with her because she cared how I had been and it was refreshing to know that someone was looking out for me.  ,,,1,1,0,0,2,0,,,,1,1,1,1,5,1,3,4,3,1,4,1,4,2,2,5,3,5,3,4,4,4,2,1,2,2,3,2,4,3,3,3,1,5,1.

3/26/14 11:43,3/26/14 12:53,183,0,0,0,0,0,0,"1) A time I felt pity for someone was when; in Chicago; I was walking down the street with my friends. We passed a homeless man who was asking for money. Rather than pay him cash; we walked into a nearby sandwich shop; bought him a sandwich; and handed it to him as generously as possible. Rather than appreciatively accept the sandwich; he threw it back at us and screamed; ""I wanted money; not some stupid worthless food!!!"" / 2) I certainly felt bad for this man. He was obviously troubled; and underwent some serious life hardships; since he was stuck here asking for money on the street. But; we had done what we could to help him and tried to avoid the situation of giving him money that he may use for alcohol and other drugs; which seems to be what he wanted. We were upset and felt for him; but at the same time; couldn't exactly stand in his shoes and try to help him any more. / 3) I wanted to tell him I felt bad for him; that he shouldn't be rude to people like that. We didn't say anything; we simply walked away. He kept yelling things at us but I didn't look back. ",,1) When my sister was in a lot of emotional trouble at the beginning of the year after getting involved with drinking at a school dance; I called her every day to see how she was doing and made sure to know that she was okay. At the same time; she was having boyfriend troubles and started to see a therapist.  / 2) I felt compassion for my sister because I wanted so badly to be able to help her and felt in part that this situation was my fault. I couldn't help but think that these things were happening because I had gone off to college and left her. I felt so much love and compassion towards her because she is my little sister and we have gone through everything together. She helps me through all my tough times and I help her with hers. To be a large and influential part of her life will always be something I want to achieve. / 3) I talked with her on the phone as much as I could and went home for a weekend to be with her. She calls me now whenever she is feeling upset and I want to be the person that is there for her; the person that can comfort her whenever she's upset.,1) When I was in 4th grade; my mom's dad died. We went to his funeral and my mom cried harder than I had ever seen her cry. Still; when a specific song that played at his funeral comes on; she can't help crying. / 2) This was one of the first times I experienced the concept of death; but more so; the emotion of sympathy. I put myself in my mom's shoes; and pictured my life without a mom or a dad; since my mom's mom had also passed years before. Even as an adult; I knew that I would have so much trouble getting through it and this made me really feel for my mom. I could hardly imagine experiencing what she was experiencing.  / 3) This feeling made me want to comfort her and tell her that I loved her. Whenever she hears that song; I hug her and try to comfort her because I focus on picturing myself in her position. I know how much songs can have meaning to people; as some have that same effect on me. ,1) I felt empathy for my older brother when he got hit by a car a year ago. At that time; he was having some substance abuse problems and was drunk as he was running across the street. It was his fault for getting hit by the car-- he was too intoxicated to remember any of what happened; and he broke his pelvis and his shoulder. Today; luckily; he can walk again and he didn't receive any brain damage. My family calls what happened an incident of sheer luck-- the day we went to the hospital to see him could have been a very different day. The morning my parents received the call about him getting hit; they thought he had died. / 2) During that moment; I was feeling empathy. I knew that it was my brother's fault and I knew that; no matter how hard I tried; I couldn't put myself in his shoes. I had never gotten drunk before and couldn't understand why he would do this to himself. I felt bad for him; though. We went to the hospital to see him and he was very vulnerable. He wasn't able to do anything on his own and this made me feel upset and sad; because he is a very independent person.  / 3) Although I knew this situation had been his fault; I made sure to support him and stand by him as well as I could. Once he returned home to live in a hospital bed in our living room for two months; I spent hours talking with him and even though I didn't understand completely what he was going through; I supported him.,1,3,1,0,0,2,,,1,,,1,1,7,2,1,1,2,1,1,1,6,3,3,5,3,5,5,5,1,1,5,3,5,2,2,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,1. sadness / 2. hopelessness / 3. ,Pity is a love where you can't really understand what the person is going through or help them much further; but simply hope that they will do something to change their ways or help themselves.,No-- I wouldn't necessarily say that pity is completely looking down upon someone; but rather not understanding their situation but still hoping the best for them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,7,6,3,6,7,6,1,7,7,6,1,3,1,7,5,5,5,3,6,2,7,3,7,7,5,1,3,3,6,7,1. sadness / 2. need to comfort / 3. worry,Compassion is a love that leads us to comforting others in their time of need; their time of vulnerability.,1,1,7,1,2,7,5,1,5,6,7,5,1,1,1,7,1,1,1,1,7,2,7,6,6,7,1,1,5,6,3,7,1. sadness / 2. hopelessness / 3. fear,Sympathy is a love that drives people to put themselves in others' shoes and deeply care about that other person's inner feelings. ,1,1,7,1,2,7,3,2,1,7,7,6,1,7,1,7,6,6,1,1,7,1,7,6,7,7,5,1,1,1,5,5,1. fear / 2. worry / 3. ,Empathy is the kind of love where you may not be able to imagine what they are experiencing; but you still support them because you see how hard a situation is for them to undergo.
3/26/14 11:56,3/26/14 12:40,184,0,0,0,0,0,0,I remember feeling pity towards my nanny after my parents decided that we didn't need her anymore.  My family treated her very well as if she was part of the family; however I knew that she didn't have much to go home to and her life was not very easy.  I felt as though there should be something I could do to help; but there really was not.  I offered her as much support as I possibly could. ,,I remember feeling compassionate towards my sister when she was getting yelled at by our mom.  My sister often gets into trouble; but this time it was not her fault.  I showed her as much compassion as possible so that she would feel better.  I felt like she was being misunderstood; but there was no way to convince my mom of that; so all I could do was comfort my sister with compassion.,I remember feeling sympathetic towards my friend who was sick in the hospital and needed to have surgery.  I did not feel like there was much I could do; but I felt bad for her and did everything I possibly could to make her feel loved and happy.  I baked for her; brought flowers and balloons to her room; and I could see that she really appreciated it; so I felt that I was in fact making a difference in how she felt; even though I was not technically fixing the situation. ,I remember when my good friend received a very low grade on her calculus exam.  I knew exactly how she felt because I had been through the same thing.  I was able to talk to her and help her feel better about herself through talking about my experience and explaining that I had felt the same way she did. I felt like I could help her a great deal because I had been in the same situation. ,1,3,0,1,0,2,,,1,,,1,1,6,1,4,3,1,1,5,5,5,2,1,2,2,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,If pity was a kind of love it would be because one person felt bad for the other; so they though they would benefit from love.,I do not think this is true; the two words do not seem related to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,6,1,5,2,4,1,3,4,4,5,4,4,4,4,4,1,5,4,4,4,5,4,5,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,I feel that a compassionate type of love would be if someone loves another based on purely caring about the other extensively.,3,1,7,1,4,4,4,1,4,5,4,5,1,1,2,4,1,1,1,1,3,4,5,4,5,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,I think that showing sympathy demonstrates love; but it is not actually a kind of love. ,1,1,6,1,5,2,5,1,4,6,3,5,1,1,1,3,3,2,1,1,3,4,6,4,5,5,3,4,4,3,5,4,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,I would not call empathy a kind of love.
3/26/14 11:51,3/26/14 12:40,185,0,0,0,0,0,0,I felt pity toward a boy at my old high school when his mother died. His mother had been battling cancer for the past two years; and although it was expected; on the day she passed everyone was very sad. I didn't really know the boy but I felt pity for him because if I was in his shoes; I would be extremely sad. During this situation I tried to be his friend. I wanted to be able to be there for him to talk to but for a while he just didn't want to talk to anyone. ,A time when I felt tenderness toward someone was when my brother didn't make the high school hockey team. He had been playing hockey his whole life as a goalie; which is the hardest position to make a team as. He played on several travel teams throughout his whole life and when he got into high school his friends convinced him to try out for the hockey team. He worked so hard at tryouts and was better than all the goalies; except one of the goalies who was trying out was the coaches son. My brother ended up not making it; which pretty much ended his hockey career. I felt tenderness toward him because I didn't know what to do or say to make the situation better. I felt like anything I said would make the situation worse. ,I felt compassion toward my grandmother when she was in the hospital. One night she had a really bad stomach ache and didn't think anything of it. The next day she was rushed to the hospital and they found that she had bacterial meningitis. My mom told me it was really serious and I was really scared. I realized how much my grandmother meant to me and that if she was gone; a part of me would be missing. I felt more compassion toward her than anyone ever and I just wanted her to be okay. The only thing I did was pray that she would be okay; and it worked because she is healthy today. ,,,1,1,0,0,3,0,,,,1,1,1,1,7,1,3,3,3,1,7,4,7,6,2,1,1,7,1,1,1,1,6,1,5,4,3,4,1,1,2,4,2,7,1. sadness / 2. grieving / 3. caring,Pity is the kind of love that you give to someone when they are sad; or when something tragic happens. ,I don't really think this is true because of the fact that pity is a type of love. ,1,1,7,1,3,3,2,1,7,1,7,2,1,3,2,2,1,1,7,6,3,3,6,5,4,2,2,2,2,3,1,7,1. love / 2. caring / 3. uncertainty,I would call tenderness a gentle; delicate; caring love because when i felt tenderness for my brother; I felt bad that he didn't make the hockey team,1,1,7,1,2,5,1,1,7,4,7,1,1,1,2,6,1,1,1,1,7,1,7,6,5,6,2,1,7,7,1,7,1.

3/26/14 11:43,3/26/14 12:51,186,0,0,0,0,0,0,In psychology class; we watched a video on these two conjoined twins. They had to live a difficult life because they were extremely different from the rest of the population and they had many physical; biological and mental challenges to overcome because they were two people attached to one body. Even though the documentary showed that they were capable of living on their own as functioning members of society; I couldn't help but feeling pity for their situation. I was feeling like I didn't exactly want to know more and I didn't really want to sympathize for the situation; because they seemed fine. It was just unfortunate they ended up having to go down that road in life. I didn't want to do anything or say anything because again; they seemed okay with their lives. I just pitied that they couldn't have a life like the rest of the population.,My boyfriend was going through a difficult time trying to figure himself out. After a particularly bad day with a lot of negativity from the world against his choices; he cried. It was the first time I'd seen him cry in all of the time I'd known him; and it was a bit frightening; because he never cried about anything. I felt like I immediately had to comfort him and make him stop crying in any way possible. I really just wanted his pain and suffering to stop; so I said nice things to him and made sure to hug him. ,,In church; there was this lady who was having lots of trouble with her two sons and her family life in general. She told the congregation how her divorce with her abusive husband had messed up her relationship with her children; who have no respect for her; and who have many emotional and psychological issues due to the strained relationship of their parents. She was telling us about how taking away her eldest son's video games would warrant a fight with dirty words and physical violence; so much so that she would have to leave the house. Even though I never went through a situation like that; I couldn't help but want to understand her. Sitting there; I felt sad and horrified for her life; and also wanting to help. I didn't say anything; I thought about talking to her son and seeing if he was okay after their fight. ,It was either junior or senior year of high school; and I was hanging out with some other friends at my friend Nicole's house. I hadn't seen Nicole in a while; so I didn't really know what was going on in her life at that time. After her parents left the house; Nicole began to talk about them (her parents) and I learned that she was having a difficult time with her parents.  / I don't know if she still likes her parents or has a good relationship with them this day; but back then she was struggling with the whole family dynamic. From what I heard; she disliked her parents due to their rather dominating parenting styles. She didn't like how they had complete control over her life and their often insensitive  personalities. Another friend vouched for her that her parents were indeed control freaks. I immediately could feel empathy towards Nicole because I can relate very much to her situation. My own parents were the kind that she had to deal with; and at that time I was having a difficult time liking my parents as well. I didn't say anything in particular; except maybe that I understood how she was feeling because her experiences were like my own as well. ,1,3,0,2,1,0,,1,,,,1,1,7,1,1,7,1,1,7,1,6,1,4,1,4,6,1,1,1,1,5,4,2,4,1,2,1,4,3,3,1,6,1. disgust / 2. sadness / 3. shock,Pity is not a kind of love,Yes; I think it's true.

3/31/14 11:03,3/31/14 11:51,187,0,0,0,0,0,0,A time I felt pity towards someone is when the Los Angeles Lakers lost in the playoffs in horrible fashion last year to the San Antonio Spurs. The series was extremely brutal and one-sided and I was embarrassed to be a Lakers fan. I felt badly that they had done so poorly in playing and I wished more than anything that the situation would change but it didn't. I wanted everything to change. I wanted to be able to help and go back in time but I couldn't. I just sat there in disbelief and said how mad I was and yelled at the television even though I knew it wouldn't change anything. ,I felt tenderness towards someone when I was dating their ex-girlfriend. They had been broken up for  a while and it wasn't someone that I was extremely close with; but every time we saw each other it was a bit awkward and uncomfortable. I was feeling kind of embarrassed and a little mean. I wanted to fix the situation and make it less awkward but I just kind of ignored it and moved past it with out saying anything. I kind of just let it be and the situation only got more and more awkward each time it happened and now I don't see either of these people anymore because I don't go to high school with them anymore. ,When one of my friends accomplished something he had been working on for years was a time I felt compassion. At summer camp; every year; one of my best friends Jacob had been trying to hit a bulls-eye in archery. When we were 10 years old; he could barely hit the target at all. The next summer; he could hit the target with ease but he wouldn't come close to getting a bulls-eye. The next year after that; he finally hit the bulls-eye and I was so proud that he had accomplished this. I was personally feeling happy and proud because my friend had accomplished something. It was if I was sharing his emotional state of happiness with him. I wanted to cheer and scream. I got up and clapped and told him congratulations on a job well done. ,a time I felt sympathy for someone was when they showed the families of the passengers Malaysian flight 370 on the news. They were all screaming and crying and I felt really bad for them but there was nothing I could do. I wanted to help; but I was no where near them; I didn't know them; and there was simply no way I could help. I felt very helpless which made me feel sad and trapped. Because I was sharing emotions with people who I didn't know personally it was hard for me to find a real emotional bond between us.I ind of just sat there and watched feeling sorry but not taking any action. ,A time I felt empathy toward someone was when my grandpa; my mom's dad passed away. I was in high school and my grandpa had been in bad shape for a few years now. My mom and the rest of my family had to watch his decline over the years. When he finally passed; my mom was very upset. A little depressed and sad at most times also; I felt her pain. I felt the same emotions she was feeling when I was around her and was talking to her. I wanted to be able to fix the situation; but there was nothing I could do. I felt helpless. I was there to console her; talk to her; and try to bring her out of the sad state she was in. I talked with her about what she wanted to saying what I felt would brighten her mood. ,1,4,0,2,1,3,,,,,,1,1,7,2,2,6,1,2,2,5,5,4,4,6,5,1,5,5,4,3,2,4,3,5,3,1,3,3,3,1,1,5,,I would not call pity a kind of love. ,No I do not think this is true,1,2,5,5,2,7,4,6,3,2,5,3,4,1,2,3,4,3,3,3,4,4,1,5,2,1,3,2,3,2,1,2,,I would not call tenderness a kind of love.,6,5,1,2,4,5,4,2,1,6,1,5,4,1,4,1,5,5,1,1,1,6,3,5,4,1,4,2,5,1,3,5,1. joy / 2. pride,I would not call compassion a kindof love,1,1,7,1,2,4,1,1,6,2,2,1,2,4,2,5,1,1,6,6,5,2,3,4,2,1,3,2,4,5,1,5,1. caring / 2. sad / ,The love of someone you don't know personally because they have gone through a difficult time. ,1,1,7,1,2,6,1,1,6,7,6,6,1,1,1,3,1,1,4,3,6,1,5,6,5,4,1,1,3,2,4,6,1. helplessness / 2. sad /  ,Empathy is the kind of love you feel when you can identify with someone who you have a very close personal relationship with.
3/31/14 11:07,3/31/14 11:51,188,0,0,0,0,0,0,I would say that I most likely felt pity in almost a sarcastic situation.  I would have to say I felt pity when my friend's boyfriend had another girl trying to talk to him.  I felt pity towards the other girl because they boyfriend had talked to her all the time before he dated my friend; and she kept trying to talk to him when he was dating my friend.  My friend's boyfriend told her to leave him alone since he now had a girlfriend.  Since the girlfriend was my friend; I didn't feel to bad for the other girl especially since she was talking to my friend's boyfriend.  But at the same time; I felt somewhat bad for her because the guy had gotten her hopes up.,I would most likely associate a tenderness experience for one about my mom.  This can be more of a general feeling; but I will describe a specific one.  When I found out my mom was married before she had me to someone else whom died of Lou Gehrig's disease; I knew she needed someone to care for her.  Since it happened so long ago; she didn't want me to feel bad for her; she just wanted some tenderness. I was supporting and I stood by her side and was loving and caring. I hugged her and held her as we sat on the couch after she told me this.  She wasn't crying; she was just appreciating my tender loving care.,I felt compassionate towards someone when I told them I was in love with them.  My ex-boyfriend would be the best experience I can tell about having compassion towards someone.  I would say that I had been developing some strong feelings for him that grew by the day; and this is what I consider compassionate.  The feelings I had through this compassion were how strongly I cared about him; how nice I was to him; and the fact that I fell in love with him. I knew how compassionate I felt in the exact moment that I told him I loved him.,I felt sympathy for the person I like to consider my second mom.  She had a step son my age whom I was pretty good friends with.  Junior year of high school; a tragic event that was unexpected happened.  He committed suicide.  Nothing was wrong with him; and he showed now signs of why he did it.  He was one of the nicest; most popular; well known kids at the school and in town.  After everything happened; I stood by my second mom as much as possible.  I was always there for her to give her my sympathy for this horrible; sad situation.  After he was buried; I showed her my sympathy by helping her put a flower on his casket and helped her walk away from something no one should have to walk away from. ,,1,3,1,0,2,0,,,,1,,3,1,5,1,5,3,3,1,6,2,2,1,3,5,2,4,4,4,6,6,2,5,2,3,2,1,4,5,3,3,1,2,1. sad / 2. sorry / 3. bad,I would not call pity a kind of love because it doesn't really associate the emotions you get from love with it.,I would have to disagree with this.

3/31/14 11:56,3/31/14 12:58,189,0,0,0,0,0,0,I feel pity towards someone who doesn't try in school or in sports and expects results. It was my High school roommate for a while. He wasn't naturally smart; but he was an unbelievable athlete with a lot of talent. He never put the time in the gym; but he always expected results. I pitied him because he always expected to get things without doing anything. I was feeling like there was not much I could do besides feel bad he didn't workout and therefore never felt satisfied with his results. I wanted to get him to work hard; but I can't be a motivator to a person; it's an internal motivation one needs to have. I just didn't acknowledge when he was all down on himself; because I knew he had it in him to achieve his goals.,My grandmother had terrible accident that eventually led to her death. I felt tenderness toward my mom and her sisters as the mental state of my grandmother in the hospital was a disaster. She suffered a stroke and a bad brain bleed. She was not mentally the same person and each time my mom went to visit it became emotional. I never want to experience a time where my mom isn't the person I know her as. I was thinking about trying to comfort her; but that was more of my  dad's role. It was just a tough feeling for me too; but obviously way worse for my mom. We as a family didn't end up talking about the situation too much until her passing. My brother; sister; and I all went to a school away from home and therefore only saw our parents every few weeks. My mom seemed to improve as my grandmother was on a slow road to recovery; but I still felt bad. ,I feel compassion when we have our family reunions as I always want help and make it as fun as possible for my 40 younger cousins. I was feeling and thinking like the more energetic and excited I am; the better time I will have and the better time my younger cousins would have. What I did is acted energetic and got involved in the most meaningless and stupid activities. I would always pump up the group and make them excited to do their best. ,I felt sympathy for my brother when he had his two open heart surgeries. HE was going through a tough time and I felt bad that he was going through all of these surgeries that kept him out of contact sports and caused him to be inactive for a long time. I didn't know why this happened to him and why I was perfectly fine. I sympathized him when I was able to go to summer camp that summer and when I was able to compete in contact sports. I felt genuinely bad for him. I would never wish this upon someone. The only thing I really could do to show my support was to get pricked by a needle for his INR machine to show him that it didn't hurt. Now it doesn't really affect him too much; but at the time I felt bad for him. ,I felt empathy towards Jordan Morgan last night as it was his last game as a Basketball player. I watched his interview as he got very emotional and with the tears going down his face as he answered questions from reporters. He said it was the most fun he had ever had playing basketball and that this was an unbelievable group of guys. He was proud of his accomplishments; but you could tell he was not ready to move on from basketball. I didn't really have a feeling to relate to because although I played sports in high school; it was more of the moving on to college that gave me this nostalgic feeling then actually becoming best friends with a group of guys. Also; the main sport I competed in was skiing; which is an individual sport. There was nothing I really wanted to do at this moment. I just watched the interview and it gave me the chills watching him get all emotional. I felt empathy that he would never get to play competitively the game he loves so much. It was like watching Brett Favre retire from professional football.  / ,1,4,0,3,2,1,,,,,,5,2,4,1,4,4,3,1,2,3,2,3,5,2,4,4,5,5,3,3,3,6,3,4,2,1,6,6,3,3,5,4,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,No I would not say pity is love. ,Don't really know what this means.

I wanted to help him find another job. However; I did nothing and said nothing. ,When I talk on the phone with my father; I get a feeling of tenderness.

I was feeling sorry for him partly because the girl said no; and partly because she made him look like a fool. He was very embarrassed so I gave him a hug and told him he would find a nicer girl than that anyway. I wanted to make him feel better so we went and got ice cream. He was still upset; but he got over it when he started eating the ice cream. ",One time I felt tenderness towards a friend who was having problems with his girlfriend. She is a senior in high school deciding whether to go to the University of Michigan or Oberlin. My friend (her boyfriend) goes to the University of Michigan and desperately wants his girlfriend to pick U of M so she won't have to move away to Oberlin. I felt tenderness towards him the day that he got in an argument with his girlfriend because he started crying and was obviously hurt and sensitive. I usually tease him and play mean jokes on him; but that day I was kind and backed off. I gave him space and let him know I was there to talk to if he needed a friend. ,,I was sympathetic to my friend when her grandfather died. She had been very close to her grandfather and was understandably devastated when he passed away. However; I could not relate to her situation; since my grandparents have been dead since before I was born. Therefore; I could only have sympathy for her (not empathy). I gave her a hug and told her if she ever needed or wanted to talk to someone about it; she could talk to me. I also told her If she didn't want to talk about it and just needed a friend she could talk to me. ,"I once felt empathy towards a friend who was sick with mononucleosis and had to miss a few weeks of school to recover. I felt empathy towards them because I had previously contracted the same illness a couple of years earlier. I was feeling sad on their behalf because I could relate to their situation. I told them ""I feel your pain; I had mono in 8th grade and had to make up a few weeks' worth of work when I finally got better."" I was hoping that sharing my experiences with them would make them feel better; or at least show them that someone else could put themselves in their shoes (relate to them).

4/3/14 9:50,4/3/14 11:42,198,0,0,0,0,0,0,It is not so much a particular situation; but many instances.  There was a person at my high school that always attempted to be the class clown.  Now although many people would label him as this; the things he would say and do got very repetitive.  I eventually began to feel bad because he was trying so hard to be funny.  I wanted to tell him to take it easy with the jokes; but i did not in fear of hurting his feelings.,,One instance where i felt compassionate was towards one of my close friends.  She is a member of the dance team here at Michigan.  One day she had not responded until it was very late in the day; and when she did text me; it was not something good.  All that was sent was a frowning face made from a colon and an open parentheses.  She explained to me that a partner of hers in a dance dropped her during a lift; and that she had broken her elbow.  The reason this was so bad was because the tryouts for the 2014-2015 year were just around the corner.  She had no idea how long this injury would restrain her from her best performance.  All she could think was that if she did not make the team; she would be letting down herself as well as her family who holds unrealistic expectations over her. The only thing i could do was comfort her and help her think everything was going to be okay.  Overall i just felt compassion for her and the predicament that she was now in.  I did not know how long this type of injury would last; or how much it would affect her dancing ability; which put my thoughts at the worst place.  Even though i assumed that this injury would last until the tryouts; i still insisted everything would be fine.  I told her that it was going to be the exact same as last year; in terms of her tryout; and that there was know way she would still be feeling pain by time tryouts rolled around.  By comforting her and feeling for her; i felt compassionate because it was easy for me to imagine myself in a similar situation with the sport i am in.,,My close friend was competing over seas and had been training very hard for this moment.

I feel terrible for them sitting in the cold with ragged clothes on.  I would call this pity because every time I see them I wish I could help them; but most of the time I just continue on my way.,,A few months ago; a family that is really close to my own lost their grandfather.  Our families have been close for basically my whole life.  The other family own a huge family farm; and everyone in that family works together every day; either in the office or in the fields.  And their grandpa was the center of the whole operation.  A huge part of their lives were taken from them overnight.  I went home that weekend to go to the funeral; and the whole time I was home my family was doing something for the theirs.  Whether it was making them dinner; watching their young child; or just offering support.  Even though the weekend was full of sorrow; I feel like we helped the situation as much as we could.  ,,My cousin and I were both on our high school wrestling team.  It was his junior year and my sophomore year; and we were wrestling one of our biggest rivals.  During his match; a freak accident occurred and my cousin broke his ankle and tore all the ligaments in the ankle area.   Neither my cousin nor I enjoyed wrestling; and both of us were three sport athletes.  He had to miss the entire baseball season that year and it was questionable if he would be able to play football again in the fall.  On top of it all; his family had been going through a rough time and didn't really have the money to pay for his surgery and time in the hospital.

3/19/14 12:57,3/19/14 14:01,201,0,0,0,0,0,0,One time I was meeting with my friend for coffee; and her boyfriend decided to come by and say hi to us.  They had recently broken up and then after a few months they got back together again; so he wanted to say hi to me as a way of kind of apologizing for how he acted when they broke up and in an effort to be friends again.  He is very insecure about himself and that causes him to say some pretty awful things sometimes in order to try to impress others.  We had started out by talking about how classes were going and things like that; and then he brought up a research proposal he was thinking about writing.  He went on to tell me that he wanted to prove that it is better from a public health standpoint to not have law requiring motorcyclists to wear helmets; because then we could just kill off all of the stupid people.  He was kind of kidding but mostly not; and at this point I felt bad for him; but not in a way that I could sympathize with him.  I felt extremely embarrassed for him and upset that his insecurities would cause him to say dumb things like this; so I pitied him. /  / What I wanted to do in this situation was yell at him and tell him how dumb that comment was and that he couldnt be serious; but I felt badly for him and I sympathized with my friend (his girlfriend) so I just looked at him for a bit and he could tell that I did not like what he had to say; so we moved on to talking about something else. ,One time when I felt tenderness was when my boyfriend made me a CD full of music that we had listened to together throughout our first year of dating.  He wrote a little bit about each song and said what he remembered had been going on at the time when we were listening to the song most; and it made me feel a kind of tenderness toward him.  I already knew that he really cared about me from other experiences; but I was feeling really tender in this moment when I could look back on all that had happened in a year with him and know that he remembered it all and that it was really important to him too. ,Compassion is more of a positive emotion to me than empathy or sympathy.  Compassion can be when you try to feel someones emotions and understand what they are feeling; even if it is not a sad time.  One example of this was the other weekend when my brother won a race at the high school state meet.  It was such a big deal for him and he had worked to heard to get there; so when he won I ended up thinking about his feelings and about what he must have been thinking for the many months leading up to this moment.  I was not only proud of him; but I also had an idea of how he was feeling and I was so happy that he was feeling it. ,Continuing with the situation mentioned in Pity; I felt very sympathetic toward my friend who I was getting coffee with.  I knew that she had been having a hard time with her boyfriend and that he wasnt being very nice to her.  He had changed from how he used to be around her and me; and she was having a hard time figuring out what to do about it. It was hard for me to feel empathetic toward her when she was telling me about the hard time she was having with her boyfriend because I had such a hard time figuring out what she would keep dating him; but I felt badly for her and could extend my experiences to relate to how she was feeling; and I wanted her situation to get better.,I felt empathy toward one of my friends a couple of weeks ago when his rabbit died.  I could empathize with him because I had a pet dog that died a few years ago and I remembered exactly how that felt.  We were both really close with our pets and considered them great friends; and I could directly relate with how he felt when his rabbit died. It was more than just being sympathetic toward him; because I felt that I had a better idea of how he felt and I could imagine it; rather than just feeling sorry that it happened.,2,0,1,2,3,4,,,,,,1,2,5,1,2,3,4,1,2,2,6,1,5,3,5,4,6,6,1,2,3,3,4,4,4,2,6,5,4,2,2,6,1.

I knew the girl's sister decently well and after the passing I felt compassion for the girl; Jackie.  I felt very badly for Jackie after losing someone she was extremely close with.  Because nothing like that has ever happened to me; I was unable to completely understand how she was feeling.  However; I did feel extremely sad for her.

3/19/14 13:05,3/19/14 13:58,204,0,0,0,0,0,0,I felt pity towards my brother recently who was kicked out of his school for a semester. We'll say he did some bad things and the school decided to take action. So now he is back at home this semester with a part-time job living with my family. I felt angry and upset that he was wasting the money of those trying to help pay his way through school. I also felt disappointed with how he was handling his life and not taking it seriously. I didn't do anything because I can't really do anything at this point except talk to him. However; I don't think he will take me very seriously nor do I want to waste my time with it anyway.,Again; not really sure of this a good way of thinking of tenderness. But I think I felt tenderness toward a friend who injured themselves. They like to run and weren't able to for some time after the injury. And then when she recovered; we went for a run together. I was glad that they were back to themselves and we could enjoy something we both love to do together. I felt bad for them originally when it happened. But instead of running when she was injured; I kept her company and did other things.,I'm not really sure if I'm thinking of a good defintion for compassion. But I think I felt compassion towards a friend who took the lead of a project team I'm working on. We really needed someone to organize and take command of the team in order to make progress and not many people wanted to do it. I felt like I wish I had his talents and skills to do such a thing because he would make a good team lead. Part of me also didn't want to make that type of committment. So I'm just continuing with the team as someone that just helps toward the project itself.,"A time that I felt sympathy was when my friend failed his class last semester. I felt sympathy because he was a really good friend of mine and we worked on the same project team. The projects were worth about 50% of the final grade and a great deal of time is spent working on the projects. To have put so much effort into a class and then getting no credit made me really sympathize towards him. I really didn't know what to say cause I did well from the exams and we both got the same project scores so I didn't want him to become really jealous of me. I just was like ""that's awful; I'm really sorry; are you going to try to take it again?"" He just really worked very hard for the class and the grade doesn't show it.",I recently went on a spring break trip to the Grand Canyon. We camped in it for 5 nights. On the second to last day we were there; one of my friends hurt his knee. While he was able to walk; he was much more slow and in slight pain. I empathized towards him. I could understand what he was feeling. He is a great friend of mine and really was loving this spring break trip. So what happened was we just had to really take our time in hiking out the last day and he felt a decent amount of pain.

I don't remember exactly; but it got me a bit worried. She then said ""I think my parents are just waiting until [my brother] and I graduate to get a divorce"". This shocked me; not in that I was very surprised; but more in the way that I was completely unprepared for a statement of that nature. My parents have fought a lot before; and one time I physically stopped my mom from walking out. /  / Although I felt like a bad friend for it; I pitied Lauren. I felt like there was nothing i could do; and the fact that she was chatting me and putting it rather bluntly made me feel very separated and not empathetic. I didn't feel bad really. I just felt pity for her; in her awful situation; but not in a way that i would be sad myself.","I met a boy in October. We hit it off pretty quickly. When winter break rolled around; he went back home to California; and I stayed in Ann Arbor with my family. We were texting each other a lot over the break. I think at one point it would be something like 900 messages a day. We were ""together"" in that we weren't really dating anyone else; and we had said the ""I love you""'s to each other; but I still wasn't really sure if it was romantic love I was feeling; or deep love towards a friend you are really close to. I could say for sure that I wasn't IN love with this boy. /  / One day I woke up to a text from him saying good morning or something like that. He went on to tell me that he had a dream about me saying that we went sledding together and built a snowman then went inside and sat by a fire and drank hot chocolate. He ended with ""and when I woke up I was sad cause you weren't there next to me."" /  / I felt a huge warm tenderness towards him right then. It was like hot chocolate; just a warm glow; all happy; almost to the point where I got choked up (I missed him a lot too). I almost got choked up now just thinking about it.","There was this kid; his name was Grant; who was on my swim team with me. He was two years below me in highschool (I was a senior and he was a sophomore). Grant was my favorite underclassman. He worked hard for the sake of working hard. He didn't skip practice; and he aspired to be a great part of the team. /  / One day; practice was cancelled; so Grant; my friend Anthony; and I went to go swim at Eastern's pool just to get a workout in. Before we got in the pool; I asked Grant if he wanted to grab some food with Anthony and I after swimming; and he said no; he had to watch a movie with his brother and his brother's girlfriend. /  / Later on; I was joking around that Anthony and I would follow him to the movies and sit behind them just to bother them; and Grant said ""Why would you do that? You hate the people I'm going with."" /  / This was followed by a rather awkward pause and then I said ""You're brother? I haven't even met him"" /  / Grant looked taken aback and then his face changed to something like an ""Oh shit"" face. I started laughing and sprinted down to the other end of the pool. I felt compassion towards him because I still loved Grant (as a friend/brother figure); but I felt a little bad for him too; being in such an awkward situation.",My friend Grace lost her mom when we were both in fourth grade. I wasn't that close to Grace. Sometimes I would play with her afterschool; and she was on my volleyball team. Everyone knew that her mom walked out on her; her brother; and her dad; went to Texas and shot herself in a hotel. But nobody (except maybe her closest friends but certainly not me) heard her recount the story herself. /  / Sometimes when I was talking to Grace I wouldn't remember; and we would just play like normal; but every time something reminded me of the traumatic event; I felt sympathy towards her. The event was so big that I couldn't even begin to understand it; and she never confided in me; so I couldn't really empathize; but I sympathized all the same. I wished that the bad thing hadn't happened to her; and that she could be happy like me.,"There was this guy I ""liked"" in highschool. He started ""liking"" me first I suppose. He would always do nice things for me; like give me his jacket when I was cold; stuff like that. But at some point I gave him the message that I wasn't really ready for any kind of relationship or anything; so he moved on and that got me a bit upset. We were out with my friend Anthony; and we went to Red Robin to get some food. Anthony had to leave after a while; and I decided to confront the guy. /  / I confronted him about moving on after scarcely a week went by. I told him about how if I did send any message; I wasn't aware of it. He went on to tell me about how he's really bad with empathy and things; and went into his back story; involving an orphanage; bad foster parents; and getting bullied in middleschool. Although I couldn't really understand fully what this was like; he painted his feeling very clearly for me; so I was able to feel them too.",2,0,1,2,3,4,,,,,,1,1,4,1,4,2,1,1,6,2,5,2,1,2,3,5,1,1,5,5,7,2,2,3,1,2,2,1,3,4,1,2,1.

She is a very bright little girl who is kind and pleasant to spend time with. I don't normally enjoy spending time with children; but I very much liked spending time with her. We pretended to bake; played with stuffed animals; and looked at picture books; and I was amazed by her energy and curiosity. She would sit in my lap and I felt as thought I were her mother for a moment. I genuinely cared for her; and I hoped she would keep that sense of wonder and innocence even as she grew older. I paid a lot of attention to make sure she didn't hurt herself while running around- not just because she was a child but because I cared about her well-being and wanted to do what I would to keep her safe.,About a year ago my best friend Cassie's father died from pancreatic cancer. Over the course of just a couple years he had transformed from looking perfectly healthy to looking emaciated and lifeless. I visited her about two months before her father passed away; and I could tell she was visibly upset about how quickly her father's condition had deteriorated. I felt unable to help her because there was nothing anyone could do to save her father at this point. Once I heard later that he had passed away; I knew Cassie was going to have a rough time coping with the loss. I wanted to make it all better for her; and magically make all the pain go away; as impossible as it was. It hurt me to know that she was suffering so much. I talked to her as often as I could; gave her all the encouraging words I could think of; and just made it as clear as possible that; while I was unable to solve her problems; I was there to support her in any way I could. I couldn't put myself in her shoes fully; since I had never experienced the loss of a loved one. But her being unhappy made me unhappy; and I wanted to find a way to help her through her loss.,I met my friend Amy at a summer camp; and we quickly realized we had a lot in common. One of the things we had in common was our dissatisfaction with our own weight/appearance/eating habits. She told me she has a tendency to lose control and binge when she is emotionally upset; and she hates to look in the mirror because she feels fat and out of control. I understood exactly what that felt like because I had previously struggled with an eating disorder when I was younger. Knowing she also had a similar struggle; while this was not a good thing; made me feel a bit better about myself because it meant that I was not as abnormal as I had imagined before. I wanted to share with her my own experiences and learn more about hers so that I could help her improve her self image. I wanted to do whatever I could to make sure that she didn't suffer as much as I did before. And in talking to her about the ways I had learned to feel better about myself; I reaffirmed my own self-confidence.,Both a classmate and I did really poorly on an exam in an economics class. We both exchanged stories about why we were struggling in the class; and we decided to motivate one another to attend office hours/study regularly from now on. Knowing someone else felt the same way I did made me feel a little better about myself and that I could improve the situation- that not all hope was lost.,2,0,1,2,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,6,2,4,6,3,5,5,4,5,1,2,5,1,2,6,4,4,2,2,4,3,7,2,3,6,1,2,2,6,5,7,1.

3/24/14 15:15,3/24/14 15:52,207,0,0,0,0,0,0,A time where I felt pity is when a girl took a moment to be vulnerable with me to tell me her feelings towards me. This was very unexpected to me; but part of me felt bad because I did not share those same feelings at the time.  However; because I felt bad; I told her that I would take her out on a date to make her feel better. I did this out of pity; since again; I felt bad that I put her in that situation and that I did not feel the same way about her.,A moment when I felt tenderness toward someone is when they broke down crying in front of me after a hard workout. I am still not very sure why they were; but I made sure that I had to comfort them. I had to be warm and caring; and to make sure that they were alright and weren't hurt. I was protecting them from the outside; making sure no one else was staring or inquiring.,A time where I felt compassion for someone is when they lost their father. I have never dealt with that; but I couldn't imagine what it would feel like if I had lost my father. I knew it was my duty to console this friend; to be there for them; and to be a support system for them.I wanted to help them to the best of my abilities. I had to do my best to make sure that they felt my full support throughout their personal loss.,I had a friend who had recently lost a grandparent that they didn't really know that well; but they were still upset by it.  I felt sympathetic towards them because I had a similar experience where I lost a grandparent that I did not know that well. I could pretty much relate to everything that my friend was telling me. How they wished they spent more time with them; and got to know them. I remember feeling that same way; but I was able to offer guidance; by saying that they can use this lesson for the future. To focus on the people who they really care about and to make sure they don't feel that feeling again.,I was consoling a friend about not getting a summer job. I had been there before; where I applied to summer jobs and I did not get any of them. I could feel what they were feeling. I could relate. I could put myself in their shoes.

I was thinking that it was awkward when he told me his score when i told him I did ok; almost wanting me to him my score. I avoided that situation by telling him that I too didn't do as well as expected and left it at that. ,I felt tenderness towards someone when someone else was making fun of them repeatedly. The individual wasn't a close friend but I felt bad for him. I tried talking to the person who was making fun of him and tried to tell him to stop. I also tried to initiate a dialogue with the other person and see if I could talk to him about what was happening. i advised him to go speak with a teacher or someone if the problem persists. ,I felt compassion when I was with my friends; especially when we went on our Spring Break trip. We shared laughs and had a good time which brought everyone closer together. I was feeling happy and also thinking about plans for next years spring break trip.

3/26/14 10:59,3/26/14 12:41,209,0,0,0,0,0,0,My mother was laid off right before my senior year; after working with a company for over 20 years. After she came home and told me; she expressed such confusion about the future and her path in life. She reflected on everything she'd done and her disillusionment with all the choices she had made leading up to that point was apparent. I felt so bad; but didn't know how to relate. So; I decided we should go out to eat; anywhere she chose. We did; and she said she felt better. ,When I was six; my dad won me a stuffed animal at a local carnival. It was a small; blue dog--nothing special; but I became very attached to it. I brought it out with me in public until I was about nine and; even today; still sleep with it when I go home. That being said; when I was about 8; I took a trip to Oregon with my mom to stay with my grandparents. Obviously; I brought the stuffed dog. When it was time to go; the dog was no where to be found. We searched for hours and hours; as I cried and cried. but my mom wouldn't give up and said we wouldn't leave until we found it. We finally did. I felt such an affection for her; a tenderness; even right now; as I'm typing; I feel a tenderness toward her.  ,I used to volunteer at a retirement center. There; I met a blind woman. We talked for a while; and she told me her husband had died but that they used to always dance together. He would take her out dancing; often times to jazz music. Then; she asked me if I would dance with her. She said she'd need some one help because she couldn't see. The absence of music also made it difficult. Despite that; I felt compassionate toward this woman and her situation. i helped her stand up and we slow danced in the middle of the common room for upwards of ten minutes. ,My best friend and I have always had busy schedules--different sports teams; lots of clubs; a bunch of homework. On top of that; her parents were constantly fighting. She was just having a rough month in general. I sympathized with her because I understood what it was like to be really stressed out and to have your parents fighting a lot (mine did too.) One night; I came over unannounced; with ice cream and her favorite movies. We sat their all night; eating and watching movies. ,My best friend's parents go divorced and there were lots of money issues involved. This was right before our senor prom; and; because of these circumstances; she couldn't buy a prom dress. We grew up in a generally affluent community; so it was rather uncommon for our friends to not purchase $400 + dresses. But my parents were also struggling with money; and I; too; wasn't going to be able to buy a new dress. I empathized with my friend because I understood where she was coming from. ,2,0,1,2,3,4,,,,,,1,1,7,1,6,3,4,1,6,6,6,3,1,6,2,6,2,2,6,6,6,4,6,4,4,5,5,5,5,2,3,6,1. sadness / 2. sympathy / 3. ,I don't think pity is love. You can pity people you love; but you don't have to love someone to do so. ,Pity has some negative connotations. When you pity someone; it is often implied that you are looking down on them; that they are much smaller than you; are needy; require help. I don't necessarily agree. I think often times pitying someone is just not being able to relate to their type of problem. You pity them because you have a lack of understanding for their circumstances and situation; not because you think less of them as people. At least; sometimes. ,6,2,4,5,4,4,3,5,2,7,2,4,1,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,4,4,7,5,4,1,4,1,2,1,1,2,1. affection / 2. gratefulness  / 3. ,I do think tenderness is a form of love. i think it's provoked by something; that it's being thankful; sort of.

It was winter and we were walking home from somewhere; I don't remember where; but it was night time so probably dinner or a show of some kind. I'm from a small; wealthy town and I had never seen poverty or homeless people before; and on this particular walk a woman approached us and asked my dad if he had any money. She looked worn. Her coat was so old I couldn't even tell what color it was; and her shoes were help together by spit and dreams. My dad politely turned her down and kept walking; until my mom saw the baby in her arms. She stopped my dad and said ""Mark; she has a baby."" and he immediately gave me $20 and sent me back to the woman. I just felt horrible that I was growing up in comfort and the baby wasn't. That image has always stuck with me.",A little while ago my friend was having a really rough time with school; work; and sports. We live together; and she was sitting in our kitchen freaking out and trying to get things done when I walked in. I immediately noticed her panic and felt the need to protect her and make it go away; so I calmed her down a bit and offered to make her some food or help out with anything if I could. She is what I would call a stormy person inside and she struggles with things. When she gets that way I just feel an incredible tenderness for her and an overwhelming protectiveness.,I went to Italy this summer; and on the flight over I had an aisle seat. Across the aisle was this little Turkish Grandmother all  by herself. My best guess is that her children or grandchildren flew her over to the US to visit them in their home there. She was tiny and frail and quiet; and she just triggered this compassion in me. She spoke no English and I speak no Turkish; but we spent our entire flight trading smiles and mimed words. When she needed something she would look and me and try to act it out while saying the words in her language; and I would flag down the flight attendant or get her what she needed. At the end of the flight she gave me the biggest smile as I helped her off the plane. ,Another sports story; sorry. Apparently I'm quite one-dimensional. This year on my team one of the players got a knee injury that kept recurring. I felt very sympathetic towards her because this year I also had a knee injury that wouldn't go away. I understood what she was feeling because I understood what it was like to sit on the sidelines and support your teammates and how hard that can be when all you want is to participate. I would often check in with my teammate during the non-practice days and see how she was feeling; just to let her know someone understood.,When I was in high school I played soccer for a club and at one of our games during the winter a player I didn't really like broke her leg very badly. She snapped the bone in 3 places and just hit the ground. She went into shock on the field and was shaking and crying and screaming. We were probably about 15 or 16 and we were all completely stunned; but the parents jumped into action (we had a number of medical professionals on the sideline). They piled our coats on her to keep her warm until an ambulance came and took her away. I felt so bad for her; and I couldn't really imagine what that must have been like because I had never been injured badly. I just tried to understand and to see things as she would during that time; she must have been so scared. / ,2,0,1,2,3,4,,,,,,1,1,7,1,1,6,1,1,4,1,6,1,1,1,1,7,1,2,2,2,7,1,6,4,6,6,2,2,6,4,1,6,1.

She was a freshman when I was a senior (the year I was drum major); and she witnessed everything that I did as drum major; including all of my actions behind the scenes and in front of the band.  She knew how much of an impact the drum major could have on the band; and she too wanted to make a meaningful difference in the lives of some 184 band students.  The current drum majors hold ""drum major clinics"" in the second semester of the school year; and interested candidates come to these clinics to refine their marching and command calling; learn how to conduct; and practice interview questions.  I held these clinics my senior year; and my sister attended all of them.  I was blown away by her motivation and the preciseness about which she took on every challenge given to her.  She was one of the strongest candidates; if not the strongest candidate.  I was one of the ""judges"" at the drum major auditions and thought she did a phenomenal job; however; the band director did not let me sit in on the discussion of the candidates; as he thought I would be a ""biased"" judge because one of the candidates was my sister.  My sister was not chosen; and I was told that our director wanted an older and more experienced candidate.  My sister was only a freshman at the time; so she would've been a sophomore drum major.  I understood; but still felt bad for my sister because she was an excellent candidate and would have done an incredible job. /  / My sister tried out the next year; only to be turned down again.  She was beat by a mediocre candidate; someone I did not think would do a great job.  In fact; he did not do a great job.  My sister finally tried out again for her senior year; and yet again she did not make it.  I was angry at the system; at my band director; and at the other candidates who beat her.  They were not good; and the band quickly learned that they were not good.  My sister would have done a wonderful job as drum major; and the band program certainly suffered because of my band director's unwillingness to give my sister the position.  Most of all; I felt pity for my sister.  I felt bad that time after time; she was turned down.  I mostly felt bad because she truly deserved the position and she worked hard for it; so it felt unfair that she was not given the role.  I felt bad that weaker candidates were given the position instead of her.",I feel tenderness when I am holding newborn babies in the hospital.

I feel compassion toward them because I know that many of them are widowed or they are sad because they are aging and losing abilities to do things like cook for themselves.

3/26/14 11:53,3/26/14 13:43,215,0,0,0,0,0,0,I feel pity towards my niece; not during a single situation; but overall.  She has had a very rough life including growing up without a father until the age of 13 when she got a stepfather; being the less favored child when she was young (according to her) and having had a series of other issues when she was young.  She followed by not making great decisions in high school; not getting good grades; unable to keep a job; and moving out with her boyfriend as soon as she finished high school.  I wanted to help but it seemed futile since she was not making good decisions.  I felt bad for her but frustrated at the same time; that it's somewhat her own fault.,I feel tender towards my ex boy friend.  Not because of a specific situation; just overall due to his life circumstances.  I knew how vulnerable he was and how difficult of a life he has had; and it would make me feel extremely tender towards him.  For example he didn't have a father or a mother and lived with his grandparents; then when he was 1 7 his grandfather; which was the only 'father' he ever had passed away and he was not even able to travel home to say a final goodbye.  even though I have more than my share of negative memories in which he has made me extremely angry or upset; I still feel and always will feel a tenderness towards him.  When I felt this; which happened often; I expressed it through cuddling him; rubbing his back; etc.,I feel compassion whenever someone is exceedingly nice to me; when they act kindly solely the sake them them being nice and no ulterior motives on their behalf.  Compassion to me is when I feel a fuzzy; happy; love for someone; usually based on their actions.  I felt this with my old yoga teacher; when I had an injury and had to stop going to class.  She made an exception for me to charge me less for my monthly class subscription; and invited me personally over to her house to show me yoga postures that would still be safe considering my physician; and provided me with a variety of natural remedies to take home with me to help swelling.  I felt this overwhelming sense of love and fuzziness that someone was being so kind to me; and i immediately had a reciprocal feeling of warmness for this person as she was demonstrating to me.  I responded by being extremely gracious; thanking her for her help; and kindness.  Compassion to me can be equated with kindness.  I also felt an overwhelming sense of wanting to be able to reciprocate the kindness and going out of her way to help me; and do the same for her;.,I felt sympathy towards a friend of mine when her cat died.  She loved the cat; would always talk about him; and absolutely adored it.  I; on the other hand was not at all fond of it.  Then it got sick for a few months; and when I went over to her house; the cat looked like a completely different animal.  It was shaky; would not look anyone in the eye; and had most of its hair - it used to have a fluffy; full coat but had become scraggly and looked like an alley cat.  Then a few weeks later I found out that the cat died.  Even though I didn't care for the cat; I knew how much it meant to my friend; and felt really bad because I knew she must have been pretty depressed about it.  I sent her a message saying i'm really sorry to hear about her cat dying; hope she is able to handle it alright; and to let me know if she needs anything.  I just felt bad that my friend must have been suffering over the situation.,I felt empathy for my mom when she had a hip injury and was in extreme pain; and could barely get up to move around without excruciating pain.  I felt empathy with her because I am so close to her and her problems are my problems to a certain extent.  I could also very much relate to her because I have had a lot of health issues/injuries in the past year and I know what I pain and how stressful and worry-invoking it is.  I wanted to let her know as much as possible that I am thinking about her by always asking how her hip was; and trying to offer any advice/suggestions that I could that would improve the situation.

We had had some serious talks but I hadn't seen him demonstrate emotions such as crying before. One of his friends in an extracurricular activity passed away a few months earlier; and someone else sent him an email trying to set up a memorial for him. At least; that is what I think it said. I only saw the friend's name on the phone screen; and my friend immediately closed it and acted very distant. I saw tears in his eyes and he was quiet for a little while before changing the subject. I felt bad for him because of the trigger; but I didn't want to directly confront him. I just wanted to quietly be there for him; and at the time; I felt very tender in his presence. I don't really talk to him anymore; but I never brought up that situation again. ,I have a friend who is very involved with volunteer work. She needed help from others to aid with her volunteer event; but was having some trouble getting volunteers to sign up. I was initially uneasy and unsure; because I was busy myself; and I didn't know how exactly I would be able to make a difference. She described to me what I would be doing; why it would matter; and how it would touch the lives of those involved with her specific charity. Hearing her words and how personal they were really struck a chord with me and I became more willing to help her out. I ended up rearranging my schedule just to help her; but she made me feel really involved and important. I told her that I would be happy to help out; and I was feeling compassionate toward her and her cause. ,I associate sympathy with emotional; health-related issues. For example; if someone is sick; or in the hospital; or has a loved one pass away; then I would feel sympathetic toward them.  /  / One of my roommates' parents was diagnosed with cancer while I was living with her. I knew that she (and her family) was having a tough time emotionally; as well as her mother physically dealing with the ailment. I just generally felt more sympathetic toward her because she had to worry not just about herself; but very intensely about another person. I gave her more leeway for certain things; and knew that she was busy spending time with her mom at appointments so I would do small chores/tasks of hers. I wanted to help her; but I knew that I could not do much except be supportive.  /  / I had a few talks with her; saying that if she needed someone to talk to that I would always be available. Our chats were sometimes very emotionally charged. I was feeling bad for her and the situation; but I was certain that her and her afflicted parent would persevere. ,I have felt empathy toward someone when they were trying to raise awareness for a sibling who died from cancer.

3/26/14 12:32,3/26/14 13:49,217,0,0,0,0,0,0,One situation that stands out to me in which I felt pity was during 10th grade. We were asked to write an English paper. The paper had multiple deadlines; but it was possible to not pass a deadline. For example; one deadline was a date by which we were supposed to have formulated a working thesis. One could not proceed to the next part of the assignment unless the previous part had been approved by the teacher. One kid in my class; Tim; was behind on every deadline. As a result; by the time he got his thesis approved; the paper was due the next day. I remember feeling extreme pity for Tim. He had gone to my grade school so I knew his mom would be furious and ground him for months because she was one of those extremely intense mothers. He had also had his heart set on going to Harvard from a very young age; but he was guaranteed to fail this paper; which would result in a C in the class for his overall grade. A C in a class is essentially a disqualifier. I saw Tim the day before the paper was due and that's when the pity really set in. He was totally distraught. He knew exactly how badly he had messed up and it was killing him. I felt so much pity for him because I knew that he thought his life was basically over; and although now he is at a great college; at that moment he thought he would end up not going to college and settling for some job in unskilled labor somewhere. ,One time in which I felt tenderness toward someone was when a girl moved to my school from Chile. I didn't necessarily feel bad for her or anything like that. I just wanted her to not feel as isolated as she did upon her arrival. It helped that she ended up being a very cool girl.,One time I felt compassion was when my friend Daje overdosed on ecstasy when we were at a music festival senior year. While he did not die; he was never the same after that. His brain chemistry was permanently altered; and since then he was acted very strangely to the point where he lost almost all of his social skills altogether. Unlike my feelings of pity or sympathy that I described earlier; I really wanted to help bring Daje back. We all did. My entire group of friends felt partially responsible because we had been with him morning before he had disappeared to do the drug in secret. Being part of the overall situation no doubt made me feel compassion instead of just sympathy or pity. I had a longing to help him and I still do to this day. I think that is what distinguishes compassion from the other four emotions. ,I felt sympathy towards my brother when he broke his wrist and had to drive home 20 miles on the freeway in extreme pain. By the time we got to the hospital he couldn't feel his legs because his body had gone into shock. I could tell from talking to him how upset he was that he had gotten injured; not because of the pain; but because his track and field season was now over and he could not compete for the remainder of the year. This was more than just feeling bad for my brother. I could almost understand how he felt and I wanted to help him through this struggle.,I felt empathy toward my friend James when he got beat up at a high school party. Unlike the other emotions; I feel like empathy is something that one person can only feel for another person if they had gone through the same thing. I've been beaten up too; so I know how much it sucks to have it happen. For this reason; I was able to feel empathy for James. It didn't really matter whether or not he started the fight or why the fight broke out. I felt empathy because he had lost and had been beaten pretty badly; which I know from personal experience is not pleasant whatsoever.,2,0,1,2,3,4,,,,,,1,1,7,1,3,4,1,1,2,2,6,2,3,1,3,5,7,6,1,1,6,5,3,2,1,1,7,5,1,2,2,6,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,It would be a kind of love that helps those in need. ,I do not think this is true.

3/26/14 12:32,3/26/14 13:32,218,0,0,0,0,0,0,When walking down the street and seeing a homeless man; I felt pity for him.  I felt pity for him because I knew that he was in a much less fortunate situation than myself.  I knew that he must have had different challenges that have led him to this point in his life and he could use help to get back on his feet.  In the past; I have given money and food to the homeless and tried to talk to them and see if there is anything I could do to help.,When dealing with older people such as my grandparents I have felt tenderness.  When my grandmother was in the hospital I felt tenderness because I perceived her as frail and weak.  Her inability to take care of herself and need of help especially jumped out at me.  I tried to be as encouraging as possible and do my best to take care of whatever I could.  I wanted to make her as comfortable as possible.,When my girlfriend failed her exam I felt compassion for her.  After studying for the exam for days before; she failed her exam and was disappointed in how she did.  Since I knew how much time she put into preparing for the exam; I felt bad for her.  I listened to her vent her frustrations because I knew it would make her feel better.  Afterwards; I wanted to try to help her get over the disappointment and focus on the other stuff going on in her life.  ,I felt sympathy when my friends aunt passed away.  I was able to relate my past experiences in similar situations to their situation and felt bad for them.  I thought about what I could do and tried to do my best to help my friend however possible.  I felt bad for my friend and was also sad.  I sent my friend and his family a card and made their family and relatives dinner to help them out.,,2,0,1,1,2,3,,,,1,,1,1,7,1,2,7,2,1,4,2,2,1,1,3,3,7,2,4,1,1,7,1,6,2,5,3,5,4,6,4,2,5,1. sadness / 2. compassion / 3. ,I don't think it is a kind of love because people are feeling bad for people who are perceived to be worse off than themselves.,I don't think it is true because pity is a feeling sorry for another where contempt is not.,2,1,7,1,1,5,3,1,6,5,4,4,1,1,1,6,1,1,1,1,6,1,6,4,5,5,5,1,6,6,4,6,1.

3/26/14 15:20,3/26/14 16:11,219,0,0,0,0,0,0,There was a girl for whom I had strong feelings; and she felt the same way about me; but there were two other guys that she considered friends that had made it clear they had feelings for her too. This took place over the summer when lots of people were travelling; so there wasn't much opportunity for face-to-face communication; and things went poorly. This girl who had shown interest in me changed her mind and explained it to me hastily and poorly; and it was clear she was not handling the situation well. I felt like she didn't know how to deal with her feelings and she wouldn't treat anyone very well. She decided to go after one of the other guys who had feelings for her; and I pitied him. At the very beginning I thought I pitied myself but I realized she was not a great person and I was better off moving on. I felt bad for the boy she chose because I thought she'd treat him terribly because she doesn't know how to handle emotional things. He liked her so much and I just knew she would drag him through the mud and treat him badly because he was so vulnerable. I was probably a bit jealous as well; but I definitely pitied the boy; just not enough to reach out to him because I wanted to distance myself from the situation.,A few weeks ago a friend with whom I have become very close was with me late at night and we were talking about all sorts of things. We were waiting for two of our friends to finish having a conversation about their relationship (they had just broken up for the second time and needed to talk things through) and we were in a weird situation. The friend I was with was very involved in our other friends' breakup; so she was in a vulnerable place too. We talked for a few hours; some about our friends; but eventually we got tired of talking about them so we talked about ourselves. I told her all about my past friendships and love interests; mostly about high school. I grew really close to her in those few hours because I shared with her a lot of my strongest feelings from the last five years of my life. She talked to me about her past and her friends and her complicated relationships with the people we both know from college. I really appreciated having someone new I could trust and talk to about stuff like that; and I feel like we strengthened our friendship a lot that night. I consider this tenderness because we were both open and she was in a vulnerable place and emotions were running high; and we were able to just talk to each other about all sorts of things without worrying.,When two of my good friends went through an ugly breakup; it was a confusing situation. There were a lot of bad choices made and a lot of surprising emotions being felt by multiple parties and it was overall a really sucky situation for everyone involved. One of the people involved is the guy who lives next door to me; so he was my friend originally; and I only met the girl through him; but we had all become close. The first time I saw the girl after their breakup was a few days later and I could tell she was really hurt. She had been crying for the last couple days since it happened and she was still really angry at him. I could tell she was really appreciative that I came over and talked to her; because she was afraid she might not be friends with me anymore after they broke up. I really felt terrible for her because I knew it was a terrible situation and I couldn't do much about it other than comfort her; but I think I did that really well. The whole ordeal hurt a lot of people and during this conversation I had with her I felt a deep emotional connection and I felt like I was able to give her the compassion that she needed at the time.,A few months ago I went through an interesting experience with an unnamed drug. A few of us took it together and there were a lot of emotions going on from a lot of different people. One of the people who joined us came in kind of last minute and none of us expected him to be there; so it was a bit uncomfortable. He also had the tendency to make people uncomfortable and some of us weren't exactly crazy about him. I remember being kind of mean to him; like groaning when he'd knock on the door to come back in; or ignoring him if he was trying to say something. Eventually he just left us and a few hours later I went to kind of a dark place in my mind. It felt like what I imagine depression feels like; but it didn't last too long. I felt like nothing was worth it and that live was just a waste of time because I couldn't find joy in anything. This feeling lasted less than half an hour; and then I got over it (it was due to the drugs; I'm sure). But a few minutes later I thought about the kid that we were mean to. I imagined him being somewhere by himself having these dark thoughts after we'd all been really mean to him. I was afraid that he was going through the same thing I did; so I texted him asking if he was alright and apologizing for kicking him out. He said he was fine just watching TV in his room; and even came back later apologizing for ditching us (I guess there was some misunderstanding about why he left). I thought I knew what he'd be going through and felt bad that he'd be doing it alone; so I wanted to make sure he was okay.,Earlier this school year; in late October; a friend of mine had a medical condition that was somewhat serious. He had to go the hospital and have a procedure done. He had an abscess on his butt; making it uncomfortable to walk around and even sit down. I could tell he was in pain and at a lot of inconvenience; but I didn't know what he was feeling; and it didn't really affect me emotionally. It was more of a thing to joke about than something I had to comfort him about. I probably told him that it must suck; but I didn't comfort him or feel his pain. I explained to people if they were curious and he didn't want to talk about it; but I didn't do much to help him other than that. I understood that he was uncomfortable physically; but that understanding didn't change the way I felt emotionally.,2,0,1,2,3,4,,,,,,1,1,7,3,4,7,1,3,1,1,7,5,5,7,4,7,3,4,7,7,6,3,5,4,2,1,2,2,3,1,1,6,1. jealousy  / 2. anger / 3. ,Pity is not love in any way,Yeah; because pity is like recognizing someone's in a crappy situation but not caring enough to worry you too much.

3/26/14 15:20,3/26/14 16:05,220,0,0,0,0,0,0,A time I felt empathy was when I heard that Philip Seymour Hoffman died. He was one of my favorite actors who recently overdosed on drugs; ending his life at a relatively young age. He had been through rehab and had made a huge effort to try and get his life back on track; but addiction can be powerful and recently he lost the battle. I just kept trying to read about him; hoping it wasn't true; with questions as to how this could have happened. I felt really bad for him. Drugs are a choice; but everyone makes mistakes and he really did his best to make sure this wouldn't happen to both him and others. Unfortunately; it was too powerful of a force that night. I didn't really do much because I couldn't do much. I didn't know him personally. ,A time I felt tender was when I saw Berta at a family reunion. It has been a rough past few years for her. A few years ago; about 5 or so; her husband Rich fell while working outside; causing him to be paralyzed. That took a toll on his last few years; affected obviously him but also Berta as well as the rest of their close family. I felt devastated too; how could I not; but as I don't get to see them too often; it simply took a harder toll on them as they were closer to him. A year ago he died and I saw Berta at the family reunion. She was happy to be there and happy to see so many family members she had not seen in a long time; but you could tell this was a hard time for her and that she was a bit emotionally fragile. I felt a mixture of sadness; yet wanting to do what I could to cheer her up. All I did was talk to her and give her a big hug. I think the family reunion really helped her. ,,A time I felt sympathy was when my little brother didn't get invited to a party by one of his closest friends. This was about 2 years ago; so he was in the 6th grade; and I felt bad for him because he thought the guy throwing the party was one of his closest friends; and from this; you would think he would expect to get invited to this party. The party had some of his other friends too. He came home crying and was clearly in a lot of pain. I felt sympathy because I had similar experiences happen to me. I have had it where some people I think are close to me don't end up being as close to me as I thought. I could tell he felt lonely and sad; and in turn; I too felt lonely and sad. I felt this way both because I could relate to him and because it was my brother and I could tell how badly he was hurt. I wanted to try and help; but my mom already was taking care of it; so all I can remember doing is telling him that I felt bad for him and then went downstairs. Later; when he was starting to get over it; I played Playstation with him to try and cheer him up. ,,2,1,0,1,2,0,,1,,1,,1,1,6,1,4,1,1,1,3,3,5,2,1,3,1,5,4,4,2,1,5,1,3,3,1,1,3,4,3,3,1,4,1. Sad / 2. Shocked / 3. ,I would not call pity a kind of love. I felt bad for him and his family and stuff; but I can't say that I loved them or anything. To me; pity is not love because that would require one to really internalize their emotions and problems; when I couldn't really do that in this situation. I felt bad and stuff; but not broken as I did with my brother and Berta. ,No. I think pity is closer to compassion and caring than contempt. Contempt is more of no connection to their emotions; where with pity I feel there is some. ,2,1,6,1,2,3,3,1,7,5,5,4,1,1,1,7,1,1,1,1,7,1,7,3,4,5,5,2,3,5,5,5,1. Sad / 2. Positive / 3.

3/26/14 15:20,3/26/14 15:45,221,0,0,0,0,0,0,,Last year I was in a tutoring program for students with a non-ideal living situation most of whom came from an impoverished background. This was my first experience working with kids in the 4th grade. Although we assisted all students all tutors were assigned one student in particular to work with specifically. Doug was my student; we spent about 3 moths together everyday after school for an hour or two. At first I took the assignment as strictly a job but soon I felt myself looking at Doug like a younger sibling. He told me on several occasions that working with me was the best part of his day; and I truly felt the same way. After his work was finished I would always stay a little longer to play computer games and read books with him.,During my Junior year of high school I meet a girl that I became very close too and were very close friends that year. After becoming quite busy in the summer and following school year our friendship really dropped off. It was not until this past summer that we really talked again. Our lives had changed so much in this time but she was still someone I could confide in. During this time the nature of our relationship had changed and we began dating but; because I had never been so close to anyone she always made me feel free to discus whatever was on my mind. We had a very compassionate relationship until we both went to different schools for college. ,About three years ago my best friends mother got into a car accident and she was injured badly. I spent almost everyday with him and I saw a deep sorrow grow in him after this because of how close he was to his mother. I felt so bad that something so horrible could happen to him and I could not stand to see him in this state. I made as many attempts to cheer him up as I could but the only thing that improved his mood was the passing of time. I talked to him very seriously and wanted him to let his emotions out but he had always been a person of strong moral code and stayed to himself. ,,2,0,1,1,2,0,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,6,1,3,3,5,5,5,3,5,4,5,3,2,4,4,4,3,4,3,4,5,5,4,3,5,4,4,3,4,2,3,1.

She told me that her brother had recently tried to overdose and kill himself and that she was very confused and upset about how to handle the situation and she needed a friend to support her. Hearing about her troubles made me feel want to reassure her that I was there to help support her through her hard time. I wanted her to know how much I cared about her; and that we could get through this difficult time together. We stopped on our run so that I could give her a hug and I told her that no matter what she would always have my support and that I cared about her very much.,I volunteer in the hospital and sometimes I need to help transport patients to and from their rooms. One day; a lady came in to visit her husband; however she could not walk so I needed to escort her up to her husband's room in a wheelchair. I always try to be pleasant with patients because many of them are going through difficult times. This visitor told me that she was very frustrated because she was suffering from a degenerative disease that was causing her to lose her ability to walk. Her husband was in the hospital psychiatric facilities because he had been suffering many mental illnesses. She then became embarrassed and apologized for telling me all her problems; but I insisted that I did not mind at all. I felt awful as she told me about her situation because she and her family were suffering so much. I wanted to tell her how sorry I felt and that I wish there were something I could do to fix the whole situation; but I did not want to make her feel worse or find me condescending. I told her that I understand how frustrating it must be to not be able to walk and that I wished her and her family all the best. She seemed to feel a bit better and I tried to take her mind off all the negative emotions. When she came past my desk on the way out; she gave me a big smile and said goodbye; I felt good because I felt like maybe I had helped take her mind off her problems for at least a few minutes.,A friend of mine recently applied to college only to be denied from her top choice school. She was very confused about what to do and did not feel a strong desire to attend any other schools or know what she wanted to study. She decided to attend community college for a year while she decided what she wanted to do for her future. We were recently talking about this over breakfast; and I felt bad that she was so confused and frustrated. I reassured her that she would end up where she needed to be and told her not to worry. I felt empathy towards her because I understand that it can be confusing and frustrating to not know what you want your future to be like.,2,0,2,4,2,0,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,6,2,1,2,6,6,1,7,7,1,6,1,5,1,6,4,1,5,4,5,4,7,6,7,7,5,1,1,6,6,7,1.

4/4/14 13:53,4/4/14 15:44,223,0,0,0,0,0,0,I felt pity when I heard that one of my best  friends was denied from the University of Michigan.  We had both hoped that; after graduation; we would be roommates at the University of Michigan and continue our already strong friendship over the next four years.  Part of what made me pity him was the fact that I had gotten into Michigan; and I know this probably made the situation tough for him.,I felt tenderness towards my dog after returning home from my first semester of college here at the University of Michigan.  Throughout highschool (and really my entire life) I have always had such a soft spot in my heart for Rosie; my dog. My heart cannot help but melt whenever I see her greet me at the door with a stuffed animal in her mouth; wagging excessively and so excited to see me.  I also have a tenderness towards her because I have always slept next to her and this is a bond we have always shared.  To return home from after not seeing her for an entire semester really affected me and reminded me about this heart melting; tender love I have towards her.,I'm not sure what compassion means; to be honest.  I guess I felt compassion when my friend learned that he had Mono and would need to leave school for a month.  Obviously; this would be a really tough situatino for anyone.  I felt the need to reach out and cheer him up.,One event in my life that evoked sympathy was when one of my best friends here at Michigan heard that her mother died.  While I did not hear this from my friend directly; upon hearing it; I immediately felt horrible for her and wanted nothing more to provide her with anything at all that would help her through this rough time.  What's more; I couldn't help but think about how such an event would tear me apart; and how I would be able to move on in life.  I felt an impulse to call my mom and tell her that I love her.  After thinking about my own mother;  I decided to help my friend out buying her a smoothie (speicifically her favorite kind).,I felt empathy towards my best friend when; after receiving too many concussions; was told that he could no longer play football and would have to give up his dream of playing in college. When I was told this;  I immediately felt awful for my friend because I had gone through a very similar situatino my sophomore year of high school; and could thus empathize with him.  I too had a dream of playing sports in college. I wanted to play baseball (a sport I loved and played my entire life) in college; but due to two failed elbow surgeries; was told that I would have to give up the sport. Thus; when my friend got the concussion; I felt I would be a really valuable source for him in getting him through this tough time. ,2,0,1,2,3,4,,,,,,1,2,6,4,3,2,4,1,3,2,5,4,4,1,4,2,3,2,1,1,4,6,4,5,3,3,1,4,1,3,4,5,1.

4/4/14 13:58,4/4/14 14:41,226,0,0,0,0,0,0,When my brother and I were growing up; we were so much alike.  We looked the same; dressed the same; got the same haircuts; attended the same schools; got the same grades; and had some of the same friends.  Everything changed when we went to school; though.  I went to Michigan; he went to State (already pitiable); and our grades were worlds apart.  I did pretty well; 3.5 average; all As and Bs.  My brother; though; failed roughly 10 classes.  He never went to class at all; and was never motivated.  I thought he was just throwing his life away; ruining his potential career.  Then he was diagnosed with depression; and it all made sense.  It wasn't that he got dumb when he moved away; it's that the motivation he had when our parents were around evaporated; and he spent the days sleeping; or staying inside.  That's when I felt pity for him.  I knew he was suffering and that it wasn't really his fault.  I wanted to help; but there was nothing much I could do.  The best thing for him was to go see a shrink and get medication; and I couldn't do that for him.  The only bad part is that there was nothing for him to do about it until he was diagnosed; so it's really hard to decide who's responsible.  I don't blame myself and I don't blame him.,Probably the most vivid situation I can remember is back in elementary school (as silly as it sounds).  I had a crush on this girl; I don't even remember her name.. maybe it was Amanda?  Anyways; we were really young and weren't any good with our emotions; so expressing something like that was so difficult.  Mostly I just let her get away with things I didn't tolerate from others.  When she'd read over my shoulder or play with the blocks I was using; I would let her.  I didn't want to stop her; nor did I feel like it would be right to stop her.  One day though; she yelled at me for sitting in front of her and blocking her view; and that was that.  What can I say?  We were six.,,The times I feel the most sympathetic are when people I know are going through hardship.  I have a friend named Eric; who I had been friends with since 3rd grade; and he loves his pets.  He always owned a dog; and since his family is quite small they always meant a lot to him.  So when one of his dogs died; I felt terrible for him.  It's an experience I've gone through so many times; and I knew whit it would be like for him.  I decided to try to make him feel a bit better; so I opened up photoshop and loaded a picture of the ghosts from the classic star wars films.  To them I added a picture of his dog; all ghost-like; but happy.  I thought it would at least make him feel a bit better; though in reflection I don't really know why.  ,"I always feel empathy of some sort when I see friends going through the same difficult classes that I had.  Physics 240 was an early example.  I got through the class okay; I did well on the tests (in general) and I did okay on the in-class iClicker quizzes (in general) but the studying took a long time and it was definitely a challenge.  When my friends went through the class a semester later; I knew what they were going to be facing.  Whenever they dropped by to complain about a terrible couple homework questions; I nodded my head knowingly.  I wasn't going to tell them ""oh yeah it's easy"" because I knew it wasn't; and it would be insulting.  But I definitely did say ""yeah; I know what it's like.""

4/4/14 14:55,4/4/14 15:43,227,0,0,0,0,0,0,I felt pity when my friend one time came to me with academic problems. He was extremely frustrated about all this work he had to do and how everything was too close together. He was extremely worried that he would not be able to finish it all in time and get away with good grades. When asking him when he found out about the assignments and heard that it was assigned weeks ago; I attributed his situation to his procrastination and lack of initiative. From there on; I tried to give him straight; honest instructions on how to go about his days. I told him to cut out his social life for the next week or so and solely focus on his work. I even told him to throw out prior commitments with clubs etc. to work on his classes. During that time; I felt extremely disappointed in him. I thought I was better than him and that I would not have been in such a severe situation. I also felt the urge to abandon him. I wanted to leave him with my advice and allow him to fend for himself. I felt very little compassion. One part of me thought of the prospect of feeling guilty for abandoning him; but another part of me also thought that this is a good lesson for him to learn if he is to succeed later in life. In the end; I did abandon him; allowing him t fend for himself. When he came back to me with disappointment over his grades; I expressed further disapproval of his actions (as he had decided to go hang out frequently during exam time) and told him to get his act together. ,,,Recently; I felt sympathy for a friend whose grandmother was in critical condition. During that time; it affected my relationship with her because I thought she was very delicate and was extremely sensitive to words or jokes that may come off wrong. When talking to her; I felt bad for her and her situation and worried that she wouldn't be able to share with people her sorrow in order to ease the burden of suffering. I offered her my ears and advice/friendship if she ever needed anything. She thanked me and the conversation ended. Upon her return to school; she seemed happy but now stressed about her classes since she missed a whole week of them. From there on; I felt worried about her graduation plans and whether she would become extremely stressed next year due to the possibility of dropping one of her classes this semester. I wanted to give her a hug; hang out with her one on one and see how she was doing in general; and just try to connect with her again (since our friendship was becoming distant as well). However; I have not followed up with that plan but plan to do so in the future. ,One time I felt empathy was when I was talking to my friend during high school on Facebook. We were discussing things she had to do with her extremely hectic schedule and being on multiple club committees and having extremely hard classes. During that time; I felt quite sad for her because I didn't like to see her suffer so miserably. I felt as though she was going to break down and not be able to triumph over such menial tasks compared to what the more important things are in life. As she described her feelings of bitterness towards the other people on her committee and their lack of work ethic or competence. I felt a tinge of anger and sorrow that she had to deal with such things because I certainly understood that same feeling when working in group projects. She moved on to wanting to scream in her pillow or cry. During that time as well as when she mentioned how she was going to manage the next few weeks; I kept thinking of ways to help her with her stress; her focus; and for her to find time to relax just a little. I also offered my help if she ever needed anything. When I hit walls of thought; I decided to instead resort to sending her music I thought would help her focus and feel more positive. All the stress she feels and I feel even now is something that should never cause anyone to break down or even cry. That is not the point of college or education. It should provide a fascinating and curious standpoint on sophisticated / novel things. ,2,0,1,1,1,2,,1,1,,,2,5,3,1,4,3,6,1,1,3,2,3,5,5,6,5,6,5,1,1,5,5,5,4,4,3,7,7,3,1,4,4,1. disappointment / 2. anger / 3. disapproval,Pity is NOT love. ,Yes in a sense because pity and contempt both embody that feeling of anger and jealousy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,1,7,1,3,4,1,1,7,1,5,4,1,1,1,6,1,1,1,1,7,4,5,4,4,5,4,5,2,5,1,7,1. sadness / 2. frustration / 3. helpless,Sympathy would be a type of love where one person is dominant over another in terms of providing affection when the other person is in great need. this would resemble a mother consoling a child who has been hurt. ,1,2,4,1,5,5,2,4,4,4,5,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,5,5,6,5,5,4,5,5,1,1,2,5,1. anger / 2. sorrow / 3. disappointment,Empathy would be a kind of understanding type of love.

4/10/14 14:48,4/10/14 15:44,229,0,0,0,0,0,0,I used to work with a guy who had an alcohol abuse problem. We worked in the same factory together; and he'd often come in for our early-morning shift pretty hungover and looking somewhat disheveled. He was an older guy; probably in his 50s or so. It was my understanding that he had had a pretty tough life up to that point; which didn't necessarily justify his excessive drinking but definitely made it somewhat more understandable. Over time it got worse; and he showed up to work still noticeably tipsy one morning and dozed off while doing some hand assembly. Rather than fire him; the plant manager decided that they would start breathalyzing him every morning when he got into work. The idea was that if he failed; they would have him wait around in the office until he was sober enough to drive and then he would be sent home without pay for the rest of the day. They hoped this would help curtail his drinking some; but ultimately they had to let him go as he was simply missing way too much work and was unable to meet their requirements for continued employment. I felt bad for the guy; but didn't know him that well or know what I could do about his situation. I would say that I felt pity in that I didn't get any joy out of his suffering; and wished there was something that could be done; but didn't feel particularly able to intervene or contribute positively to the situation. Still; it was sad to see him struggle to maintain an appropriate level of sobriety for work; and knowing that he didn't have much family around him; I wished there was more of a support system available to him. The whole thing was kind of sad to see play out.,Tenderness is also a feeling that I felt towards my friend with the substance abuse problem. When she was staying on the couch in my house; we would often spend a lot of time talking about the things that she was going through and the things that she wanted from her life. I always thought of her as a sister in some ways; and wanted to alleviate her material suffering as well as to be open and comforting with her in an emotional way as well. It was important to me that her emotional wellbeing improve as well as her physical living conditions; and so as we had many deep conversations about things I would also open up to her about things and try to be understanding and supportive of the things she told me as well.,A good friend of mine was experiencing some drug abuse problems for a few years; and she was in and out of her parents house and sometimes living on the street as well. At times it seemed like she was genuinely ready for help; and at other times it seemed like she had little or no regard for the consequences of the decisions she was making. She had stolen from people before to help fund her addiction; so it was difficult to trust her or to have her around. She'd sometimes come around pretty strung out; as well; which made it very impossible to really interact with her or she'd drink to the point where she needed constant care and attention. She pretty categorically refused treatment; so we were forced into deciding what to do about her living situation. She was someone I had been friends with for a long time; but she had also taken advantage of my attempts to help her in the past. Regardless; I was unable to deal with seeing her being homeless and on the street; so I let her come and stay on my couch for about a week. I just wanted to do whatever I could to try and diminish her suffering or improve her quality of life; even though I may have just been providing a warm place and consequence-free place to go for her to stop using. I wanted to make sure that she was safe; even if I may have been enabling her to some small degree. Despite what she had done to betray my trust in the past; I couldn't live with her being out on the street.,An acquaintance/friend of mine had a friend of theirs die. I did not know the person who died; so I didn't really have a connection to them; but felt bad that my friend had to deal with the grief that accompanies such a loss. I didn't think that I could really do much to alleviate their suffering; and didn't feel that we knew each other well enough that I could be of much or any comfort to them; but I felt sympathy for them in that I understood they were going through a difficult time and hoped they could find a quick and meaningful closure. I attended the viewing and told them that I was sorry for their loss; but didn't stay very long or really engage them in any meaningful conversation of substance.,A close friend of mine recently lost her grandparent; whom she was very close to. She was understandably devastated; as she had never lost a grandparent before and was unsure how to cope with the feelings of loss.  I had already lost all of my grandparents at this point; the last of which was my grandmother who had passed only about 8 months before; so I very much understood what it was that she was going through.  I was pretty close with my mom's parents much like she was her grandmother; and I could remember what it was like when they passed. I empathized with the tremendous emotional reaction and sense of loss; and wanted to do what I could to help her through this situation. It ultimately brought the two of us closer; as we were able to talk through a lot of how the situation made us feel. I wanted to try and explain to her that things would get better as time passed; as they had for me; and that ultimately she would have a better grip on her emotions as she moved through the various stages of grief. I think it was good that we both had each other to talk about these things with; and to have someone other than family; who is similarly affected; to help the other cope with the death.,2,0,1,2,3,4,,,,,,2,1,5,1,1,3,1,1,1,2,4,2,1,4,2,6,5,5,2,2,5,2,4,2,2,1,6,4,6,6,1,5,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,I do not think that it is a type of love.

I felt pity for her and I felt bad for her. I also felt very disconnected from her because she was not open in sharing her problems or talking about them. I wanted her problems to go away and to make her eat and everyone also secretly thought it was a cover up for an eating disorder. I would sometimes talk about it with her but it was hard. I would say "" this situation is so bizarre and unfair. I can't believe you have to deal with this. You're so strong"" but when i walked away I merely felt disconnected from her. Our lives were so different as I was eating and happy; and she was anorexic and miserable.

I wished I could have gotten her out of the relationship but at the end of the day; I knew that she would not. Also; sometimes my empathy would turn into anger because she would not listen to me.

Last week was their spring break; so we had full day child care and I worked all day on Friday. We only had about 12 kids when we usually have around 100 to start off. There is one girl who can be kind of a handful; but all of the staff loves her anyway. She is in 3rd grade and she has a lot of friend drama going on right now. At one point on Friday; she ran up to me sobbing and told me that her best friend had told her that she didn't want to ever play with her anymore. I tried to comfort her; but she was hysterical. I felt really bad for her and really angry at the other girl; because we have had a lot of problems with her meanness this year. I wanted to go talk to her and make her apologize (even though I knew she wouldn't mean it) just so that I could attempt to do something. I didn't necessarily feel her sadness; I just felt bad for her because she keeps going back to this one mean friend when she should go find some new friends; or just hang out with the the me and the other counselors when her other friends aren't around. It just made me wish she could realize that; even though she's so young.",,The summer before I started my senior year in high school I went on a mission trip with my church to Washington DC. For 2 hours each day I worked at a Vacation Bible school in one of the worse parts of the city. Many of the children there were at high risk for AIDS because of their parents or their situations; and some already had cases of it within their families. It was definitely a situation that was shocking and out of my comfort zone the first day; but as I got to know the kids I fell in love with them. I have always loved working with kids; but this was such an amazing experience. One girl stood out to me a ton; because she constantly clung to my arm; and we became very good friends in only 5 days; she was 10 years old and never wanted to go home at the end of the day. And honestly; I didn't want her to either; because I didn't know the details of her situation; but if she was that afraid of going home; they couldn't be good. At the end of the week; she told me I was her best friend; she asked me if she could come home with me; and she told me that I should never leave when I told her she would have to stay here. In this week; I felt like I wanted to do whatever I could to get her out and to help her have a better life and to give her the love and support she needed as a 10 year old girl reaching her teen years. But I knew I couldn't and I felt heartbroken by that. I was so hard to say goodbye; and i cried quite a bit throughout the weeks after; but I know I will never forget her or the other kids in that neighborhood. They hold a special place in my heart; and if I ever get the chance to go back; or to change their situation; I would never pass it up/,"Yesterday my friend in my German class came in and looked really upset and kind of flustered. I asked her if she was doing okay; and she told me not really. She was really stressed out; and had slept through 3 different alarms; missing 2 different classes; and a scheduled meeting for office hours. She also said she thought she was getting sick and she really just wanted to be done so she could go home. As she was telling me all of this; I felt sorry for her. I felt like if I had been in that situation; I would be upset; I felt pity. As she was telling me what happened; I just kept saying; ""oh that sucks; I'm sorry."" I didn't know what else to say; because it did. I also told her I was sure our professor would understand that mistakes happen and that she didn't purposefully skip the meeting. I told her that we're all stressed; but that soon it will be over and she can go home feeling really accomplished that she finished her freshman year of college.",My friend told me the very detailed story about her past relationship. She is a year younger than me and she told me that she is in love with this guy still and wants to be with him but he cheated on her multiple times. I felt so much empathy for her because I saw a lot of myself at the same time last year in her. I was cheated on in a relationship and I had the same feelings as she did at that point after our break-up. When she was telling me; I could feel the pain that she was describing; I could feel the emptiness and hopelessness; even though; I don't feel them for myself anymore; I felt them for her. I was thinking of the ways that I coped and what helped me get over the situation and wanted to tell her; and tried to tell her; but as I was; I knew that it wouldn't do much. When I went through this; so many people tried to help me; and I really appreciated it; but nothing they said helped. It was something I had to work through on my own terms. I knew that all she needed was someone to listen and be her friend; she didn't want people to tell her it would be okay; because she didn't think it would and got annoyed when people did; just like I did. So I didn't tell her it would be okay. I just let her rant and cry and tell me everything she wanted to about the situation and her feelings. and I felt them with her.,2,1,0,2,0,1,,,1,,,2,3,4,1,5,2,5,1,1,5,3,2,2,6,2,5,3,4,4,5,4,4,6,4,5,3,5,5,2,2,5,3,1. sadness / 2. frustration / 3. ,I don't think pity is love.,I don't think it is true,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,2,4,3,1,7,4,7,3,7,3,1,7,7,5,2,1,1,7,7,5,1,7,2,6,7,2,1,7,7,2,7,1. sadness / 2. love / 3. ,Compassion is definitely love.

6/5/14 10:05,6/5/14 11:17,236,0,0,0,0,0,0,To me; pity is either when I feel sorry for someone who is somewhat inferior; or when they caused the situation and it backfired on them. It can be just as detached as compassion. For example; I felt pity toward someone on a TV show; when he accidentally destroyed something very valuable. It was a comic book in mint condition that he was going to sell for two thousand dollars so that he could afford his wedding. On his way to the pawn shop; though; he stumbled and the comic book fell out of its cover and into a puddle; rendering it completely worthless. I felt really bad for him; because he really needed the money and it was just an unfortunate incident; and because it reminded me of when I had accidentally lost or destroyed valuable items. However; I still felt like it could have been easily avoided if he had just been more careful. I suppose I did sort of feel like he was inferior to me; because I imagined that I would have been more careful and less clumsy; and would have avoided the situation. I wanted to go back in time and fix it for him; but obviously; I couldn't (and it didn't matter because it was a TV show).,Tenderness is a more affectionate emotion than any of the others; and it can be felt in much more positive situations. It is sort of like a gentle kindness or a gentle affection. An example of when I felt tenderness is when I met my baby niece for the first time. She was so small and looked so helpless that I just had to be as gentle as possible with her. I felt a great deal of affection toward her; because she was now family; and perhaps also because I felt like I had to feel that way toward a helpless baby. I picked her up as carefully as possible; taking care not to hold her too tightly or too loosely; because I was terrified of hurting her. I just wanted to hold her and to help her in any way that I could. I suppose tenderness is somewhat similar to pity; in that you often feel it toward someone more vulnerable than you; but it also is less detached; closer to love.,While compassion is similar to empathy; I think it is slightly more detached. For example; I can feel empathy toward my friend; but for strangers; I feel compassion. One example of when I felt compassion was when I heard about the shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. When I heard the news; I was absolutely shocked and horrified and thought about what it must be like for the parents and friends of the people inside the school when they heard about it. I tried to understand their pain; but felt like I never really could until I experienced a similar thing; or at least until I had a child. I could try to imagine what they were going through; but because I didn't know them and I hadn't had a similar experience; it was less powerful than empathy. I still did try to imagine it; to understand. I wanted to help as much as possible; although I knew it would be difficult - I would not be able to comfort someone directly; only help by raising money or raising awareness.,Sympathy is similar to both empathy and compassion; but it is less involved than empathy and less detached than compassion. I would feel sympathy toward someone I know but only if I could not understand what they were going through. One example of when I felt sympathy is when my friend's father passed away. He seemed to be healthy; and it was an unexpected heart attack that left everyone in disbelief and shock. I started crying when I heard the news; but mainly because I felt so awful for my friend; not because I knew him or because I knew how she felt. I tried to understand what my friend was going through; but since I had never had a family member die; especially one so close to me; I just couldn't understand. I felt like I really wanted to help; but I just wasn't sure how I could help; because she needed people who could better understand the situation. I tried comforting her; but I didn't feel like it did very much to ease her pain. I actually told her that I couldn't imagine what she was going through; but that I would try to help in any way possible and I would be there for her if she needed me.,To me; empathy is when you can actually feel someone else's pain or disappointment or other emotions. It often comes from having experienced that same emotion. An example of when I felt empathy toward someone is when my friend's dog passed away. She had had that dog since she was born; and he was one of her best friends in the world. He died unexpectedly after being hit by a car. When I heard; I was first shocked and in disbelief; and then the pain washed over me. Not only did I feel for my friend; sorry that she lost her best friend; but I could also understand and feel the pain myself; because I went through a similar experience when I lost my beloved dog to a reckless driver a few years earlier. This experience brought back the painful memories of that day. I thought about the phone call I received from my parents while I was at school; the wave of shock and disbelief and pain that hit me so hard I had to sit down. I thought of the first day without her; expecting to hear her clacking across the floor but only hearing silence. When I came over right away to comfort my friend; she mentioned that she had the same experiences. I told her that I was really sorry for her loss and that I understood exactly what she was going through; because I had gone through the same thing.,2,3,0,1,2,4,,,,,,2,1,5,1,3,2,1,1,2,2,2,2,6,6,5,3,6,6,1,1,3,5,4,5,1,1,5,6,2,2,1,5,1. sympathy / 2. superiority / 3. scorn,To me; pity is not a kind of love. Like with compassion; you can feel pity even when you don't know or don't like someone.,I think this has a grain of truth in it. If you pity someone; it does not necessarily mean that you have contempt for them; especially those you think inferior to you; like children and the handicapped; because it is difficult to hate someone in a situation like that. Pity is more related to superiority; thinking that if you were in that situation; you would have done better. However; there is something along the lines of scorn or disdain.,6,6,2,2,4,4,6,2,4,5,2,5,6,2,6,7,1,1,2,2,6,1,6,1,5,7,1,1,5,6,5,6,1. love / 2. fear (of hurting her) / 3. ,I would call it a kind of love; a kind of affection. It is a love that is reserved mainly for those who seem helpless or vulnerable; those with whom you feel the need to be gentle. ,1,1,6,1,4,4,1,1,2,2,5,2,2,6,2,6,1,1,6,6,6,2,6,3,3,4,2,3,6,5,1,6,1. sympathy / 2. helplessness / 3. ,I don't think that compassion is a kind of love - it is much more detached than that.,2,1,6,1,2,6,1,1,5,4,2,4,1,2,1,6,1,1,2,2,6,2,7,5,6,5,2,2,7,7,2,7,1. frustration / 2. shock / 3. ,Sympathy is a little bit like love; in that it shows that you care for someone and want to try to understand what they're going through; even if it is impossible for you to imagine. It is more of a friendly affection than full-on love; though; because you can feel sympathetic toward people you don't know very well (although I don't think I feel sympathy toward total strangers; but rather compassion).,1,1,7,1,3,4,4,2,6,7,6,6,1,5,1,6,2,2,5,5,6,5,6,4,5,6,2,3,5,4,5,5,1. sympathy / 2. pain / 3. ,I don't think it's necessarily a kind of love. You could feel empathy even for someone you hated; but showing empathy and acting on the feeling could be showing them that you care.
8/4/14 10:00,8/4/14 10:39,245,0,0,0,0,0,0,As a vice president in my sorority; one of my duties was to work with our advisers to approve or deny excuses girls would send in to miss out on mandatory events; or to explain why. In order to ensure that people actually show up for things; girls have a certain number of excuses per semester. One girl wrote to us asking for more excuses because she was beginning to apply to grad schools; was studying for a test (the MCAT or GRE); and was also working. However; our chapter advisers voted her request down; meaning she now also had to balance the sorority into that mix. At the time my sister was doing almost the exact same thing (minus the sorority involvement) and I knew how stressed she could be. I felt pity because this girl really deserved the extra excuses I though; and so I was angry at the advisers (who are older women) for not understanding how times had changed and how it is acceptable to miss several events. So after all the voting was done and I had to go tell the girl; I also had the president come with me; and together we worked out a deal between us to help her technically have more excuses; but it just wouldn't be documented. ,I felt tenderness when my boyfriend was telling me how he often got homesick. As an international student; he only sees his family once or twice a year; and having recently relocated across the country for a new job; he is feeling it more now because he had to leave Ann Arbor and all of his friends here behind. I felt tenderness for him because I understood how split he must feel: excited to begin his job and make new friends and memories in Seattle; but also how frightening it must be; and how much it aches internally when something is too new. I am moving to St. Louis myself soon; leaving behind my family and friends as well; so as he was telling me how he felt (scared; anxious; excited; just wanting familiarity) I was imagining how I will feel in a few weeks; and tried to act in a way that I thought would be comforting to me. I told him what a great opportunity he has; and what a great job he will do. I reminded him that when he came to Ann Arbor he felt the same way; and look how quickly he got to feel at home here. I made sure to stress the fact that all his family and friends are here for him if he needs anything; that the distance wont matter because there's still the ability to visit; and they are all cheering for him. ,,My grandmother was recently diagnoses with an aggressive form of dementia; and she has been doing badly ever since; moving from one care facility to another. It is very trying on my dad; who not only has to travel several hours to come visit her; but who then is not guaranteed that she will remember who he is when he arrives. My grandmother was a very optimistic person; a sweet grandmotherly type; who had traveled to dozens of countries and to all the continents in her lifetime. Seeing her frail; nervous; quiet; and lost is something no one in our family is able to get used to. As the oldest; my father was made responsible for carrying out her will when the time comes; and that realization hit him quite hard. It has made him reconsider how his own life is going; and I see how uncertain it has made him. ,My hometown has a large homeless population. Whenever I travel home I see them on the side of the roads with signs; or laying down under overpasses just trying to find shelter of any kind. This makes me feel sad and helpless; because I do not know what I could do to help them; especially since I would love to help them all; but I do not have the resources to do that. This is especially hard in the winter months around the holidays; because while my family; friends; and I are all warm and celebrating; trying to stop the holiday weight gain; those poor souls are out there freezing and starving. I feel selfish because I have so much when they have nothing. But then I feel confused when others tell me to not worry about them or tell me to not give them anything because they brought this on themselves due to drugs; involvement with gangs; or laziness. ,2,2,3,0,1,3,,1,,,,2,1,5,1,5,4,5,4,2,5,4,4,1,4,1,3,2,2,2,3,4,2,2,5,5,4,2,2,4,3,5,5,1. anger / 2. hope / 3. determination,I do not think it is a type of love.,I could see how it is true.

I was not sure all of the physical disabilities were real; but felt pity for them nonetheless; if they had to fake such things in order to get enough to live on.  Their circumstances were so distressing that one could not feel otherwise than pity; even if they were trying to take advantage of tourists.  What a way to live!,This morning at breakfast; I went to get half and half for my coffee and remembered that I had used the last of the carton the morning before.

This woman had such problems coping with her loss of legs that it was distressing to read about it.  I felt sorry for the mother because she was experiencing morning sickness; which is why she took the drug; and she would have been horrified if she had known what it would do to her fetus.  I remember reading about all of the cases in Germany; and thought how awful it would be for these women.  Of course there was nothing that I could do for or about this woman in the book.  Her whole life was affected and it took years for her to come to grips with her situation.  It affected her whole family; including her parents; and was such a sad situation.",A good friend's wife was diagnosed with ovarian cancer; in spite of having lived a life as a vegetarian and an avid practicer (and teacher) of yoga.

I feel bad that she is in the situation she's in; and I think that it is an awful place to be. However; since I haven't experienced what she's experienced and don't feel the same things she does; I often forget to be gracious and only pity her; continuing to be angry at her choices even though she doesn't have that many options. I recognize that her lifestyle is hard and that she only has so much control; but because I am distant; I often wrongly feel pity more than empathy or sympathy.,I often feel tenderness; and remind myself to feel tenderness; toward my little sister.

A lot of stuff had also been going on with her and her family's health. All of these things have been compounding and while I am not directly experiencing them; I care for her and see her struggling so it causes me pain for her. I talk to her about all of these thing and tell her that I'm sorry about the situation and make sure she knows that I am here for her and support her.,I felt empathy for a friend of mine whose family friend recently died. I empathized with him because my grandmother died about a year ago; and I understood the confusing emotions he was feeling; and that they are hard to deal with and comprehend because death is such a powerful force that effects everyone a little bit differently. In talking with him; I was thinking about what death does to those it touches; and that it is different for every single person. This range and unpredictableness can actually bring people closer together; as it allowed me to have empathy for my friend. ,2,0,1,2,3,4,,,,,,1,1,7,1,2,5,2,1,4,2,7,2,2,5,4,6,4,5,3,3,6,2,5,4,4,5,7,6,5,4,1,2,1. bitterness / 2. sadness / 3. anger,A very distant love.,,5,5,2,2,5,2,7,5,2,7,2,6,1,2,1,5,2,4,2,3,5,3,7,4,6,5,3,2,5,3,6,6,1. grace-giving / 2.  / 3. ,gentle; graceful; merciful love,7,6,2,2,5,4,7,2,1,7,2,6,1,3,1,4,1,1,4,4,5,1,7,7,7,5,6,5,6,5,5,7,1. joy / 2. love / 3. determination,a strong; inherent; joyful kind of love,1,1,7,1,7,5,4,1,4,5,6,6,1,4,1,6,1,1,4,4,6,3,7,6,5,5,4,4,4,5,4,6,1. sorrow / 2.  / 3. ,A true; genuine; sorrowful; and slightly distant love.

3/27/14 9:50,3/27/14 10:38,317,0,0,0,0,0,0,I think I just realized that pity and sympathy could have a similar definition. Pity is the way that you feel for someone in situation where they have just had misfortune. I felt pity for one of my friends who was a dancer. She was preparing for a competition for months with rehearsals everyday. A few weeks before the competition all of her efforts were crushed because she fractured something in her ankle during practice. I felt so bad for her because this one injury ruined her chances of competing and all that she had worked for. ,"Tenderness is most associated with the word love and I can always see the phrase ""love and tenderness"". The best situation of tenderness is when my sister fell off her bike and had scrapes all over her arms and legs. My mom just patched her up with band aids and gave her hugs and stuff to show her love and it made my sister feel better even though the pain from the fall was still there. Essentially; tenderness is a part of showing someone affection in a way that is close and has impact on the other individual. ",Compassion is a kind of love I think and it is when you show praise and gratitude to someone that has done something great for you. I had a research paper due in the morning and I only brought in a hard copy and forgot to turn it in online. I called my mom as soon as I got to school and asked her to log onto my computer and submit the document before class started. With no questions asked; she quickly did the task and efficiently and I was so grateful. I felt great compassion and gratitude towards her and was so lucky to have her do this for me. ,Sympathy is just when you feel bad for someone; even if you have no relation to the situation. This one guy was walking down the hallway with a science project. And my high school being pretty small in size; the hallways were not that big; so it just looked like a disaster about to happen. The project was immense 3D diagram of the human heart and looked like it took many hours and time and effort to finish. As soon as the bell rang; hundreds of students stormed out of classrooms towards the front door to leave; while bumping and accidentally hitting the guy. And then after one unfortunate hit; the diagram fell to the floor and broke into many pieces. I felt really bad for him; because he clearly put so much effort into his work and all of that was ruined. All I could say or do was help him pick up the pieces and there was nothing more. ,My friend had just had their dog; Beau; die and I was there with them to provide empathy because I had gone through a similar experience before. I had lost a pet recently and I knew what it was like and all the emotions that run through someone's mind when they have to go through such a traumatic event such as this and how to deal with the situation. I went over to her house and just sat and talked with her while she was crying. I could not say that much; but I felt empathy for her and her situation and just being there for her really helped her out I think. She did most of the talking with all of her memories of her dog and I just sat there listening to her vent and this process really just helped her clear head. ,3,0,1,2,3,4,,,,,,2,1,2,1,4,2,2,1,2,3,3,1,2,2,2,5,3,2,2,3,3,2,4,3,3,2,2,4,4,2,3,3,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,Pity is not a kind of love. ,I am not really sure what the saying is trying to get across. ,4,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,3,3,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,3,2,1,2,2,1,2,1,2,2,3,1,2,2,2,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,Tenderness is a kind of love.

3/27/14 11:46,3/27/14 12:47,326,0,0,0,0,0,0,"When I feel ""pity"" towards someone; it is when I feel bad for them and consider their circumstances to be unfortunate. One example that comes to mind of when I felt pity was when I was in Detroit and a man came up to my friends and I asking for spare change. He said that he was an Afghanistan veteran who was down on his luck; couldn't find work after returning to America and thus ended up on the streets. I felt pity for him because he was a former soldier who had done great things for our country and this is how he was rewarded: with no home; no job; and no prospects but to beg others for money to live on. I could tell that he wanted to put his life back together because he had made an effort to dress as nicely as possible and had a way about him that spoke to his intelligence and demeanor. I pitied him because I knew that his circumstances were not entirely his fault; he was a victim of bad luck; a bad economy; and bad government systems to support veterans with health care/employment/housing. I felt sad for him; and I felt relieved that I was fortunate enough to not have to live the same lifestyle as him. I felt a strong desire to help him; so I gave him some spare change and said ""I hope this helps"". ",Tenderness is when you have a special fondness for somebody and really care about them. I feel tenderness towards my brother because I have a special place in my heart for him and I don't feel like anybody else could replace his role in my life. One instance where I felt this tenderness was when I returned home from a six-week solo vacation away from my family; and my brother took me out on a drive just so we could talk and catch up. My mom said that he had missed me and that he said that the house seemed empty without me; and his gesture showed me that he valued me as a person too. I felt very close to him at that point because I had also missed him greatly and it was good to have him back in my life. I felt tenderness in that particular moment because I realized how important he was to me and how empty I would feel if he were no longer in my life. ,I define compassion as an understanding of another's difficulties and specifically a desire to help. When I volunteered at a food bank; I saw parents coming in with many kids in tow and signs of a lower socioeconomic status. The fact that they told me they were dependent upon food stamps and food bank donations to feed their children made me feel compassion for them because I understood a situation that was different than mine and felt an emotional attachment to their situation; and also because I had a strong desire to help them. I was thinking that I hope their situation is improved because I do not want to see them continue struggling to get by financially. I did my best to help them by providing food for them; but I wanted to do more to help; even though I know I couldn't personally help alleviate their poverty. ,Sympathy is where I am able to understand another's situation and feel the emotions they are feeling. An example of when I felt sympathy was when my dad was the victim of fraud on ebay and a phony seller ended up stealing $3000 of his money ;and he had no way to contact ebay and get back the money. I felt the same emotions he did; which were disbelief; anger; and feeling cheated. I couldn't do anything about the situation because it was his money and his financial affairs; and I had no place involving myself in that; but I did feel bad for him and sympathize with his situation regardless. I felt like I understood his emotional pain and suffered with him. ,,3,0,1,1,2,3,,,,1,,1,1,7,1,2,6,2,1,7,3,5,3,1,1,3,6,1,2,4,2,7,3,6,3,6,5,6,2,7,6,2,7,1. Empathy / 2. Sadness / 3. Compassion,PIty is a kind of love because it shows you care enough about another person to feel sad that they are going through a certain situation. ,"No; I don't think this is true. You can feel pity for someone without looking down upon them and judging them relative to yourself. It is important to keep in mind that many ""pitiful"" situations could happen to anybody; including the onlooker.",7,7,1,6,1,7,6,4,1,7,1,6,1,1,1,1,6,5,4,1,1,7,7,7,1,7,1,1,1,1,6,6,"1. Happiness / 2.

7/10/14 8:49,7/10/14 9:36,340,0,0,0,0,0,0,1. For high school; I went to a private school after having gone to a public school up until then. I remember visiting the high school I would have attended to pick up my younger brother (who just ended up staying in public school); and seeing many of the kids sitting outside waiting for their parents to pick them up. It was obvious that many of them didn't care about school; and their parents/teachers had probably given up on them too. Obviously not all the students at that school were like that; but many of the kids waiting outside were. I felt guilty and sorry for them at the same time. They were close to my age and my brother's; but they were leading such different lives from both of us; just because of their environment. I thought it was unfortunate that most of these kids; probably from a young age; were encouraged to do well in school from those around them. I thought that if I ever had kids; I wouldn't want them to be like those kids I saw; and hopefully; I would be able to help some other children in the future grow up to be more motivated to succeed academically. ,My mom and I are very close; and because I've been away from home for a long time (I went to a boarding school since 9th grade); I feel like that bond has gotten much stronger. In high school; we were required to leave campus for all breaks but in college; that isn't the case. I didn't go home for fall break and was tempted not to go home for Thanksgiving because I had tests coming up right after the break. However; I remember my mom calling me and asking if I would come home for break. The tone in her voice made me feel like it would be awful if I said no; so when I said yes; she was genuinely excited. When she came to pick me up at the airport; she was thrilled to see me; and it was then (and when I told her I'd come for break); that I felt tenderness towards her. After such an occasion; I have tried to text and call my mom more frequently and try to come home for breaks if it's not too much of a burden on my schedule. ,I volunteer at a local assisted living home frequently. This location is mostly filled with residents on Medicaid or Medicare; so the facilities are much poorer than that of private-funded assisted living homes. When I first decided to volunteer; I was reluctant as I hadn't spent much time with old people and felt like I wouldn't be able to connect with them. However; as I spent time with these elderly by playing games with them or just chatting with them; I developed a connection with many of them. A lot of them saw me more often than they saw friends or family; and they were genuinely excited to see someone outside of the assisted living home to visit and spend time with them. I felt great for being able to provide some sort of comfort for them; and decided to try to get other people to volunteer at the assisted living home. At this particular one; no one ever came to volunteer. I think the staff and residents were very pleased with the volunteer and excited to see them when they came to visit. ,There was a boy named Jay in my grade in high school. No one was fond of him because he was rude and had a horrible temper. But when my senior year started; we were told in my school's opening Assembly (similar to the idea of chapel that some schools have; minus the religious part) that Jay was in a coma. Later; I heard he had been scaling a wall on some dorm that he was staying in for a summer camp and fell from the third/fourth story. I had been in several classes with him and though I always founded him rude and short-tempered; I felt terrible for how I had felt about him before. But I felt terrible for his younger sister; who was two years younger than us. She was a staff writer on the school newspaper; which I was an editor of; and I found her sweet (and the complete opposite of her older brother). I felt sorry for her; and knew that although Jay wasn't the most loved guy; he really cared for his sister (I could tell when he talked about her sometimes). I never said anything to Katie (his sister) about Jay; but tried to be nicer to her and look out for her more. I did tell my friends that I felt terrible for Katie; and really wished Jay would wake up from his coma (I was never clear on what state he was really in. Some people said he was in an induced coma; some people said he had woken up; etc). ,,2,0,3,3,2,1,,,,1,,1,1,7,1,1,5,1,2,1,5,7,5,2,6,3,7,2,2,7,7,6,1,2,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,1. guilt / 2. anger / 3. frustration,I wouldn't call pity a kind of love.,No. Just because you feel bad for someone does not mean you dislike/are disgusted by them. ,7,7,1,7,1,1,7,7,1,7,1,7,1,1,1,4,4,7,1,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1. love / 2.  / 3. ,It's the kind of love where one is emotionally invested and deeply attached to the other. ,6,7,1,1,5,4,4,5,3,5,6,1,1,2,1,7,2,2,2,6,7,1,7,7,7,7,3,6,6,7,6,7,1. guilt / 2. pity / 3. ,It would be the kind of love that involved some sort of emotional investment; which would allow for one to care deeply about the other person one is feeling compassionate towards. ,1,1,7,1,1,7,1,1,1,3,7,1,1,7,1,5,1,1,7,7,7,1,7,7,1,7,6,7,7,7,4,7,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,A love where one is emotionally invested in the other person. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7/10/14 8:50,7/10/14 9:45,341,0,0,0,0,0,0,My friend was struggling with a lot of self-worth issues as result of some bad dating experiences. She had tried dating a few different guys; but each one wasn't interested in being in an official relationship; and just wanted to hang around when they were interested; and then would be scared off when she ever approached the subject of being together. I pitied her because she really didn't need to put herself through the situations she was putting herself in; but kept repeating the same process and making the same mistakes. I told her that she needed to find a different type of guy than she was looking at for the past couple ones; because otherwise she was just going to keep getting disappointed; and I wanted her to just relax and try to find someone she didn't feel the need to be fake for; and just be herself around. I pitied her that she wasn't doing that for herself.,My boyfriend was suffering from extreme exhaustion; to the point where he couldn't function and was shaking and needed to rest. He needed me to get him dinner and help him rest for the remainder of the day. I felt tenderness for him due to his need for me to help him function the rest of the day; because I knew if I weren't there he probably wouldn't have fed himself that night; and my role as a caregiver brought out those feelings of tenderness toward someone who was relying on me. I told him he shouldn't get out of bed; that he needed to sleep and that I was there to take care of him and get him what he needed; and he didn't need to worry about anything else. ,I felt compassion for my grandma when she was struggling to walk. My grandma has a bad knee due to an old injury and arthritis; and if she walks on it too much it gets very painful for her and she tries to just get through it; but my whole family can tell when its really bothering her. We've gone on many walks where we've made frequent stops to let my grandma rest her knee; because she insists on going on walks despite the pain. Myself and my family all feel a great deal of compassion for my Grandma; and want to take care of her and ensure that she isn't pushing herself too hard; even though she is determined not to let it stop her.,I felt sympathy towards my sister when she was dealing with problems with peers at work. My sister and myself have always been a bit different then our peers due to the way our parents raised us; and so we've both had difficulties fitting in and getting along with peers. She often gets frustrated dealing with peers because they tend to form cliques and exclude her; which is something that also happened to me on occasion. I feel sympathy for her because I know its difficult sometimes dealing with these people who think just because she's not a typical teenage girl she doesn't belong in their group; and I try to tell her that it's more important to find people that will love you for who you are than try to be friends with people who won't; and that they aren't worth her time; because that's something that I've found in my experience.,My friend was having family and money problems; and was worried she would have to take out loans in order to pay for college since her divorced parents weren't agreeing on who was going to pay. She's my best friend and her divorced parents have been arguing since I've known her; especially about money; because her mom is in debt and her dad thinks his child support has been enough over the years; and so there's always been a money struggle between the two. Once she went to college it became more difficult with tuition checks. My parents are married and we've never really struggled with money problems; so although I couldn't directly relate I could imagine the precarious situation she was in and felt really bad about it and wished I could help or give advice. For the most part all I could do was be a shoulder to cry on; but I tried to help her out the best I could.,2,1,0,2,3,4,,,,,,1,1,7,1,4,3,3,1,1,4,3,1,2,6,3,6,3,5,4,4,5,4,4,4,2,2,7,4,1,1,2,1,1.

However; one of my friends int hat class; who was doing the worst out of all of us; did not get the extra credit even though she needed it the most. I pitied her.,My older brother slipped and fell down the stairs. I felt a tenderness towards him; aske dhim if he was ok; and offered to help him get up or get him ice. he wasn't badly hurt; he was just a little surprised and a little bruised. I remember wanting to take care of him to make sure he was ok. He seemed fine though and got up so there wasn't really anything I could do.,I saw a commercial on children in africa who were hungry; poor; had little clothing on; were caked in dirt; and had a sad expression on their face. There were sitting in the streets all by themselves. The commercial was asking for people to donate money to an organization that would help these children in Africa. I was very moved by these images and felt compassion towards those children in Africa who looked miserable and hungry. I thought about what their lives must be like; living in such extreme poverty; most likely without an opportunity for education and I felt as if I wanted to adopt themself and take care of them. It made me realize how priveliged I was.,I remember talking to a student here who's house burned down right before classes started. She and all her housemates had to find a last minute living situation and move out. Some of their things had been ruined. I have never experienced what it is like to have my house set on fire by I can imagine it must have felt scary; frustrating; stressful and a sense of loss. ,My friend started complaining about how bad a paper was written; unaware that the editor was in the room. She then realized the editor of the paper was in teh room and listening to her so she felt so embarrassed; sorry; and awkward for talking bad about it that she left the room. I understand what it feels like to say something bad; not realizing the person is there and listening. The feeling of shame; guilt; and embarrassment was pretty overwhelming for me too so I could empathize with what she felt. I told my friend that this happens to all of us which is why I have become more conscious and aware of when I talk negatively about something I don't like because I don't want to end up hurting anyone.,3,0,1,2,3,4,,,,,,2,1,7,2,2,2,1,3,2,5,5,2,2,2,2,6,4,4,2,2,6,5,4,5,2,1,1,5,1,1,1,2,1.

3/20/14 9:39,3/20/14 11:01,402,0,0,0,0,0,0,I felt pity on the handicapped man who worked at my elementry school. Whenever I saw him moving around in his wheelchair cleaning lunch tables I felt pity for him because it wasn't his fault that he was handicapped. Why did he has to have such a misriable life just becasue of something he was born with. I remember one day asking him about his condition. At the time; I didn't undertand that someone could be born with a physical disorder and have to live their whole life with it. I had never seen such a n old man (about 40) that had spent his whole life in a wheelchair. The main reason I think I felt pity rather than sympathy was the man couldn't do anything to change his situation where as with a sympathy the person usually is somewhat to blame. If not that person than someone else is to blame. I remember not doing anything to help the older man; in retrospect; I wish I would have tried to help. Although I knew that trying to help in anyway was futile. What was a little boy going to do to help a handicapped old man? ,The greateest feeling of tenderness I have had is while taking care of a fallen baby cardinal in my backyard. I remember walking outside on a chilly fall day and looking up into the large elm tree in my yard to see a small nest near  the peak. After looking around the base of the tree a bit I found a baby bird that seemed to be laying on the ground trying to yell out. It must have fallen the nest almost excatly above it. How had it survived? I feel hurt inside for what that baby bird was going through; just sitting there on the ground in pain and suffering. I wanted to help so I tried to lift it up with my hands as delicately as I could. The cardinal was so soft and tiny I felt as if I would break it. I saw that it's leg was out of place so I took it inside and had my mom try and treat it. She said that it couldn't be saved and that we should put it back outside. I went to school and she did just that.,Compassion is when I accidently tripped my brother while we were walking in a store. He feel and hit his knee on the edge of a table and had to go to the emergency room. I think I felt compasion over other types of feelings because I had something to do with another person being hurt. I remember feeling like it was all my fault. Well; it kinda was. I told him I was very sorry and that it was an accident; however atleast from my end that didn't end the terrible feeling I had inside. He learned to forgive me; after all it was only something small. It's just that he is my younger brother; I feel protective over him; so nothing makes me feel worse than when I cause him pain.,When my brother was taking the ACT this past year; it was the best example of sympathy I can think of. I saw that because standardized test taking always came so easy for me to do; however my brother found it every difficult. On top of that; my parents expected my brother to live up the results I had when he just couldn't do that. He would come home from the test telling me how hard it was and how he was so stupid. I just felt horrible for him because I knew that indirectly I was putting this pressure on him by how well I had down a few years earlier. It wasn't his fault; he just couldn't help that he wasn't very good at test taking.,Last week my girlfriend was stressing out over a paper for her food and nutrition class. I felt empathy in this situation because I have been in her position many times; freaking out about an exam. Nothing I felt I could do could make her worry any less. I would try and comfort her by telling that everything would be alright; she would get through this and that next week would be better. As much as I could try and comfort her; I really couldn't do anything because in this situation; freaking out the paper is her own doing. She didn't start writing far enough in advance; so now she was running out of time. I felt almost helpless in this situation. I want to make her feel better but nothing I was doing was working. Eventualy she got through the paper and turned it in and my empathy for the situation passed. This would be a bigger deal if it didn't happen all the time. I feel as if empathy is something that most people feel for someone everyday. ,3,0,1,2,3,4,,,,,,1,1,6,1,1,7,1,1,7,3,6,1,1,1,2,6,1,1,1,1,6,2,7,2,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,7,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,Pity isn't a type of love to me.

She got into some other great schools but I felt pity for her when she didn't get into the school of her dreams; U of M. There is nothing I could but I ultimately felt sorry for her because I knew how badly she wanted to go to school here in Ann Arbor. I  care for her so I reallty just felt sorry for what happened. ,I felt tenderness towards my brother when recently he and his former best friend got into a fight. I still feel tenderness for my brother because it has been 2 months and they still have not been talking. My brother is only 13 so for him to be going through this; my heart aches for him. I feel sorry for my brother and just want to give hima big hug right now. If you knew the circumstances you would understand why I feel so sorry that they aren't talking. I have told my brother that if he ever wants to talk that he can call me. When I have seen him since they stopped talking; I have given my brother plenty of hugs and told him I was there for him. I feel tenderness for him because he is still so little and really such a good kid who shouldn't be going through what he is. I still want to think of him as my innocent; sweet little baby brother so this feeling of tenderness makes sense to me. I can't  hide him from real world experiences but I just feel sorry for him. ,I felt compassion towards my mother when she was offered a job through her business that she really wanted. She was compassionate about this and therefore I felt compassion for her. I was compassionate for her because it was a job she really wanted (she is an interior designer); therefore i felt her excitement as well. I became compassionate towards her because I am so proud of her and happy for her. I respect her so much and therefore took my emotions as being compassionate towards her. I love her and I want what is best for her.,I felt sympathy towards my best friend when her dog passed away. I felt sympathetic for her because I could tell the passing of her dog was making her really sad. She wasn't crying but you could tell that she felt upset. I felt sorry for her because I wouldn't want to go through the same situation. I gave her a big hug and told her I was there to listen if she needed to talk. , I felt empathetic towards someone just recently. I've happened to become really close with this girl across the hall from me in my dorm. She has been struggling with her chem class and has been having a hard time in the class. Just recently she was considering dropping the class and receving a W on her transcript. Unfortunately for the major she wants to pursue she would have to take chem again. I immediately felt empathy for her when I saw her struggle with the decision to either stay in the class and bring up her grade or drop the class; receive a W on her transcript; and have to take the class again. I could see the stress in her eyes and how it was taking a toll on her. The deadline is tomorrow and the entire past week she has been constantly thinking about whether to stay in the class or drop. I don't want her to continue to be stressed because I ultimately want her to make the decision that is best for her. I've been a good listener the last couple days when she questions what she should do; weighing the pros and cons. I don't feel sorry for her; but I wish this decision were easier for her to make. ,3,0,1,2,3,4,,,,,,1,1,6,1,2,4,4,2,4,5,5,4,1,4,1,6,3,4,5,4,5,3,6,4,2,4,5,5,5,4,5,6,1.

3/20/14 11:01,3/20/14 11:50,404,0,0,0,1,0,0,It was during the week and my friends and I were studying together at Shapiro library. One of my friends; Annes; told me that she left her car around the packard st. and she wanted to park the car nearby the library so that she doesn't have to walk or take bus all the way back to the packard st. from Shapiro library. It was already dark outside so I said that I would willingly go with her. We all were feeling sort of hungry at that time; and Annes said that she would buy everyone fries from Frita Batidos on her way coming back from packard st. So Annes and I went out to get her car and we drove to Frita Batidos to get fries for everyone. When we got to the main st.; a homeless person approached to us and begged for fifty cents. He was wearing really old; dirty clothes; and his voice was almost gone. He seemed to be old; maybe around his 60s. I felt sorry for him because the fact that he's old and still lonely; begging for changes; means that he has no family; no house; and no children. I was first scared to see a stranger saying something to me and Annes; but then in a few seconds; I felt bad about his situation. ,I don't think I normally feel tenderness in terms of my own definition of tenderness. Tenderness reminds me of a mom breastfeeding a baby. One of my mom's colleague had a newborn baby and when I visited her house to see them; she breastfed the baby. When the mom looked at the baby when she was breastfeeding; she was looking the baby with very soft; loving eyes; and I think it was tenderness. ,,There was a screening about a North Korean refugee from one of the clubs that I joined. The screening showed how people are helping each other to rescue a single North Korean from the repression. It showed a long route/journey of a refugee; escaping from North Korea to a better environment and freedom. The harsh environments of their journey made me think that I would not be able to do it if I were in that situation and the refugees struggled so much to obtain freedom that I didn't even really think of enjoying.,,3,0,1,0,2,1,,1,,1,,1,1,4,1,4,,2,1,4,1,2,1,1,2,2,4,3,2,2,2,3,3,4,2,2,2,3,2,3,3,1,3,1. scared (in this particular situation) / 2.  / 3. ,That kind of love would be the love from the Bible where the Bible says love your neighbors.,It can be; because a person who might be feeling pity; might also feel a bit of superiority toward a person; who is pitied.,5,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,3,3,1,2,1,1,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,4,1. love / 2.  / 3. ,Motherly love,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,1,5,1,2,2,1,2,4,2,4,5,1,7,1,6,1,1,7,7,5,1,7,2,2,3,5,5,4,4,2,5,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,I would call sympathy a love but I'm not sure what words I should use,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3/20/14 11:11,3/20/14 11:57,405,0,0,0,0,0,1,I was teaching in collaboration with this old professor; and although I was the young inexperienced one; he was extremely unprofessional and seemed unable to take care of himself. He would send me emails asking me to cover for some classes; explaining that his mother and father were in a hospital and all sort of personal things that had nothing to do with work. He was desperate to talk to someone and he wanted people to feel for him so badly that I completely lost any respect that I had for him. This is what I would call pity. I feel sad that he is such a weak and weird person; but I have lost any respect for him and kept a big distance with him because there was nothing I could do for him.,I feel tenderness towards my ex-girlfriend. We had an extremely beautiful story; and I am extremely sad that things did not work out. We left each other with a lot of respect and tenderness; probably we were both still in love with each other; but both knew that this was not meant to be and that moving on was the best for both of us. So I felt incredibly sad; and I know she felt the same. And even now; that I am still in love with her; but that I am slowly letting this feeling go away; all I have left is an infinite amount of tenderness for her. It is not love; even if it implies love. It is love without hope for a future; it is acknowledgement that you believe that a person is a beautiful and great person; without any will to build anything out of this feeling. I would call tenderness uninterested.,My little sister is a medical student in her fourth year; and she is now so swamped with work that she gets litterally depressed. Even if she had doubts for the main reason that this is so difficult; she has told me many times how much she loves what she does and that this is really meant for her. So whenever she talks to me about it and she looks so tired and depressed and sad; I can't help but feel for her. I have been through tough years of studies as well; but really love what I do now; so the situation is kinda similar; even if my studies were probably not that hard. Anyway; I would call this emotion that I get whenever she talks to me about that compassion; because I know exactly what she is going through; so I feel for her; but I also know that this is for a great reason; and that she is strong enough to handle this. So somehow; this is different from pity where I would really feel I have to do something for her and maybe lose some respect for her. Here; I just acknowledge what she is going through; and of course I feel sad; but I have the greatest respect for her ability to going through this.  /  / I think compassion is extremely close to empathy; now that I think about it. /  / So whenever I talk with her; I do not say much; I just try to make her laugh and to show I am here for her. I remind her that this will end eventually and that this is a good thing in the end; And that's it; it does not bother me too much because I know she's going to be allright;,Sympathy is a feeling that you get towards someone who you are pretty distant with; but feel close for just a brief moment. As an example; I am teaching to a class of students; so our professional relationship imposes some distance. However; I cannot help feeling sympathy for some of the students when they help me out. As an example; I have this funny student; who really likes my lectures; and wants to help out. So everytime I ask a question to the class and noone answers; after 10 seconds he just goes kamikaze; raises his hands and tries any answer; as stupid as can be. And this really helps be because I can use his answer to keep on being interactive with the students.  /  / So we have of course a distant teacher-student relationship; but I definitely feel sympathy for him.,"Empathy is this feeling when you know exactly what someone is going through. It can happen for people you are close to or not at all. It is just this deep feeling ""I know exactly what he/she is going through"". /  / I experienced empathy for my little sister; as I explained in the ""compassion"" part.

3/20/14 11:59,3/20/14 12:45,407,0,0,0,0,0,0,I feel pity towards the homeless people I see on the street. I feel sorry for them but not sorry enough to do anything about it. I feel bad that they do not have a home; food; clothes; etc but I do not feel driven to give them money and often times ignore them.  Occasionally; I feel disgusted by what they are doing and I figure there are better ways to find support for yourself than for begging for money by people on the street. Since these people are complete strangers; it is easy to feel pity towards them and look down upon them. ,Feelings of tenderness are something I felt when my friend was going through a rough time with family issues. I could not even begin to relate to her family issues or understand the complexity of them. My friend was visibly upset and her family issues were taking over and getting in the way of her school and social life. I remember feeling so sad for her and feeling like I should care for her but unsure of how to relate to her feelings or exactly what to say to her to make her feel better. Instead; I stayed over late at night and watched movies with her to try and get her mind off of the situation and try and be supportive of her. I also did little things to cheer her up from making her tea to texting her more often to make sure she was ok. ,A time when I felt compassion toward someone was when I was working with them to help them to navigate an unfortunate situation. Specifically; this occurred when I was on a service trip working with a family to help re-build their house. I remember feeling sad to hear about their unforuntate situation but we were there to help make their situation better not to feel sorry for them. I felt compassion as we were working to build their house and making it a better place for them to live and to help improve their situation. By working alongside the family; we were able to get to know them beyond their unfortunate circumstance and get to know them as people. I think that component of the service made me feel more compassionate toward them than if they had not been working with us. This act of compassion was felt because I was DOING something to help improve someone's unfortunate conditions instead of just feeling badly about it. ,I felt sympathy when my brother was going through inense medical procedures. I felt for him but I could never understand his pain or what he was going through. I supported him and was there for him in any way that I could be. I tried to ask him questions to try and understand the situation better. Often; I did feel sorry for him; but I tried to hid those emotions by offering support and positivity. I badly wanted to understand what he was going through and better support him but I could not which is what made me feel sympathetic. ,Empathy is a form of sympathy that I felt when she told me that her mom was going through the same medical issues that my brother was going through. I empathesized with her becuase I understood what she was going through and could relate to her experiences. I wanted to support her in any way that I could and I know that by being able to offer her support from my experiences; I was able to help her through that situation. Feeling empathy felt different to me than sympathy because I could understand and relate to what the person was going through and I could better understand the situation. ,3,0,1,2,3,4,,,,,,1,1,7,1,1,6,1,1,2,1,4,1,6,5,6,6,4,5,2,3,5,4,5,2,3,1,6,3,3,4,2,3,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,I would not call pity love;,I'm not sure what hte meaning is behind this saying--I've never heard of it.,1,1,7,1,6,4,5,1,4,6,6,6,1,4,2,7,2,2,5,2,6,4,3,6,3,4,6,4,4,4,5,4,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,Tenderness is a deep love that gets down to raw emotions,6,1,7,1,4,4,5,1,4,5,2,4,3,1,1,6,3,4,2,3,5,4,4,4,5,3,3,4,5,3,4,3,1.

I felt that I could give her the love and support she was not receiving from her family. I wanted to get her to explain everything that led her to that conclusion and did.

I felt very sad for her and I understood how she felt because I had also not made the basketball team one year. I felt the disappointment that she was undertaking and the sadness and anger that welled up in her. I wanted to tell her that it would be alright and that there were always other things to do; including training harder for next year. I stood her up and took her to go play outside with some friends; I told her there was no point in being sad with what had transpired because she could not change it.,I remember when I saw someone who was depressed about their weight and was talking to me about it. I felt very sad and understanding because I had gone through weight problems; depression; and the social stigma that comes along with each. I wanted to show them that they could change their lives.

All of our family and friends were there to celebrate his achievement. He stood with his graduation gown and cap with a special golden tassle to identify his honors. I felt very happy and understanding. I was able to go back into my memory; to when this happened to me the year prior and all the emotions of that moment came rushing back. I felt happiness for my success; elatedness for the completion of this portion of education; and nervousness or excitedness for the things to come. I was able to feel these things for Paul which made me empathetic toward him. I wanted to congratulate him; and I did. I told him that it was an awesome achievement to complete high school the way he did and that he was going to love being able to move into the next stage of his life.,3,0,1,2,3,4,,,,,,1,1,7,1,1,7,2,1,1,1,7,1,2,4,3,5,4,4,4,4,7,1,6,1,6,6,7,6,4,5,3,7,1.

I feel a lot of tenderness towards him right now because he's trying his best to recover; but the process is slow. I have no idea what it is like to go through something like that; but I sincerely want him to get better and I believe he will. He's also very vulnerable right now to temptation; which I can understand. However; although some people are predisposed to addiction; I felt that he could have helped himself out of this a little earlier; rather than let his life spiral out of control before doing something about the situation. Now that some time has passed and he shows major signs of improvement; I feel tenderness and love for him because I can see how hard he is trying.,My friend's house recently burned down. Luckily; only the father and their 5 dogs were in the house and he was able to get all of their pets out. He was also able to save some jewelry and some artwork; but everything else was gone. When I heard about this; I couldn't imagine what it must have been like to watch your own house burn down; knowing there was nothing you could do to stop it. My friend; who is in college; must have felt awful knowing his childhood home was gone. And with five dogs; I don't know where his family is going to go now. ,I felt sympathy when my brother didn't get accepted to Stanford; his first choice college. It was far from the end of the world; as he got into other amazing schools (Duke; UPenn; Northwestern; Johns Hopkins; U of M; you see what I mean). However; it was one of the first times he'd been rejected academically; so I felt bad that he had to take that blow. It was also the first school he got a letter from; so I didn't know what that would mean for getting into other schools. I know what it is like to fail at something in school; so I could kind of relate; but I knew he would be just fine after the initial sadness wore off.,My best friend and I were lying in the same bed. I think we were about 13 years old and we've been best friends since we were three. I know her better than anyone else and I understand her emotions sometimes better than I understand my own. She has always been an insecure person; and that night I finally understood why as she told me about how her mom had made her go to a clinic for overweight children when she was in elementary school. I think if you're a girl especially; you struggle with body image for your entire life; so I could completely understand how that must have hurt her and made her doubt herself. Your mother is supposed to love you unconditionally; no matter what you look like or even act like. I told her that it didn't make me see her any differently; and I remember that made her cry. From that moment on; I felt like it was my job to help her feel more secure with her appearance.,3,0,1,2,3,4,,,,,,1,1,7,1,7,1,1,1,2,2,6,7,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,6,6,7,1,1,1,2,1,6,1,6,1. sympathy / 2.  / 3. ,I do not think pity is a kind of love at all.

I mostly feel pity towards the people who are less attractive; less physically fit and less intelligent. I will never say it to them directly but with every feeling of pity I get comes with a slight feeling that I am better than them in a certain way. However; I do hope for them to have a better attribute somewhere else. For instance; if I am walking on campus and see a stereotypical nerd rushing to class and slipping on the Ice; I will walk up to them to help them up. However in doing this ""generous act"" I tend to feel like I am his savior rushing in to rescue him from his life. Almost like a god complex. With this also comes me thinking that he will remember me as the cool kid who acknowledged his existence. The side is that I will also wish that he is going to an exam and will ace it. I have a desire to see him succeed in another facet of his life so I know that he will be happy somehow.",My blunt and slightly sexist opinion of this emotion is that tenderness is a feeling reserved for women or a man taking care of his significant other. The only times can say I have felt tenderness for someone is when my significant other fell asleep in my arms after a long; hard day. For a male like myself; I feel tenderness when the well-being of my girlfriend is completely dependent on me. It not that I don't think she is fine on her own but rather that she is but I want to help ease the burden.,When I experience a scene in public where a person is being judged or discriminated against I feel compassion towards the person. When I feel compassion it is a mixture of pity for the person being harmed and anger towards the injustice. Like in the word itself; I put much of my passion towards the situation. It cause my heart to pump and my blood pressure to raise as I personally feel hurt watching the other individual in pain. I think and do stand up for the person as much as I can. This is one of the few feelings I have that cause me to loose my temper and cause my thinking to become irrational.,,Recently; one of my new college friends had a best friend die in a complete accident. I also had my best friend die from something out of everyone's control. I could empathize with him. One thing that made the situation stand out is that for both of us; the best friend was a female. And with us both being male; we always felt like it was partially our job to protect them from the cruelty of the world. Empathy to me means the ability to understand on every level about the situation going on. When we talked I think we both felt a sort of comfort to go along with the pain of remembrance and loss. When I felt empathy it caused me to talk with him and reach comfort with the passing. It also helped with understanding a loss that felt unfair to us in life.,3,0,1,2,3,0,,,,,1,3,2,6,1,1,2,4,1,5,2,2,1,5,3,7,7,1,1,1,1,6,4,3,2,6,6,3,3,6,6,3,6,1.

3/25/14 15:58,3/25/14 16:58,414,0,0,0,0,1,0,,I recall feeling tenderness toward a woman I was dating. She had lost her mother to pancreatic cancer two years before we met. I felt I could help her through the grief  from sharing my experience with my own father's passing from pancreatic cancer.  The two moments I felt tenderness were 1) watching her gaze at a picture of her mom that was her iPhone desktop picture; and 2) 6 weeks later; I felt comfortable enough with her to suggest to her that when she find's the right way to deal with the loss of her mother; it won't hold her back or feel bad.   /  / Recalling those moments of tenderness opens the same physical and emotional sensations that I felt then and recalling those moments opens the memories of other tender moments and feeling of tenderness. The majority of tenderness feelings seem to be associated with a physical-emotional touch of intimacy with women. However; I understand tenderness is not a sexual energy.  /  / The sensation of tenderness feels or is perceived as a softening and relaxation in the mind associated with a sinking feeling of the heart organ itself. Tenderness may differ from empathy given the associated physical feeling and one's own organ sensations that stimulate one to relax the requirements or expectations of another in order to allow the other person to move forward or manage their situation without critique. ,Compassion is felt when the passions of two or more people or combination of people and animals  join their feelings together or attach their feelings and passion to one they feel compassion for.  /  / For example; I felt compassion when a family member; friend; or my pet could no longer share in an activity we enjoyed together; such as taking the dog for a walk with my mother; the loss of a friends job; or the inability of my dog to continue our long runs together.  /  / Compassionately; we find alternative tasks to enjoy together; that are tasks that we enjoy separately.  / For example; my mother's early Alzheimer's led to her inability to go on long walks; so I started a yoga program with her to join our interests.  /  / Compassion seems to not invoke any visceral response or sensation in the brain nor the heart. It's a confidence that we'll work something out and seems to originate from just the general sense of being. ,Sympathy and empathy and compassion have been difficult concepts for me to differentiate in the past. I had include dthem as all being a general understanding of another's loss. However; with maturity; more relations; more experience and being more attentive to emotions for learning how to speak foreign languages to native speakers; as well as keying in on another's emotional needs in a relation and even my own physical sensations when experiencing different emotions. /  /  / I don't feel sympathy when a friends family member passes away. I feel empathy; because I understand and share the same experience from my youth.  /  / I feel sympathy when I mentally know someone is going to have difficulty moving forward having experienced a loss; i.e. loved one; job; pet. Sympahty invokes a response to acknowledge the other's loss; but without dutiful action to alleviate their loss. Compared to empathy; sympathy is a fleeting feeling as we all deal with loss and have to make our way forward. Empathy lasts longer and invokes a sense of duty or need to help.  /  / Moments of sympathy are experienced when one suffers from an illness they contracted or a disease their suffering from due to no fault of their own. ,I empathize with others when I can feel and share an understanding of their loss; as well as hope to or actually do something to alleviate their sense of loss.  /  / For example; I empathize with my mother who is suffering elder abuse by our sister. Our mother has been emotinally abusive; isolated her; exploited her finances; and delayed medical care to our mother. ,3,0,2,1,4,3,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,1,6,1,2,3,4,1,6,5,1,4,1,1,1,5,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,4,3,2,3,3,4,3,2,5,1. love / 2. affection / 3. attraction,Tenderness is tangential to love. One can experience tenderness without love or knowing the other person. Although my experiences are associated with love and attraction. For example; I automatically feel tenderness toward an infant regardless if their a member of the family; a friend's baby or at the nursery. So tenderness includes some perception of vulnerability; yet I give adults their due respect by believing they are mostly in control of their situation. So tenderness can have many contexts. Common denominators maybe vulnerability; an affection toward the other -non sexual or sexual; i.e. non sexual would be general concern; general caring or general reponsibility toward another human or animal. ,2,1,7,1,2,6,5,1,5,7,2,4,1,2,1,3,1,1,1,1,4,1,5,4,4,5,2,2,3,4,3,5,1.

3/25/14 16:56,3/25/14 17:48,414,0,0,0,0,0,0,1) I feel pity whenever I see a homophobic or racist or other such negative person on the news; online or in person. I cannot imagine being that narrow-minded and hurtful. /  / 2) I feel like they should educate themselves; just look at the world they live in and realize that their antiquated notions have no basis in reality. I end up getting extremely riled up and angry. /  / 3) What I want to do is immediately voice my opinions to combat theirs; for example downvote or report slurs on a messageboard online; join organizations like HRC; sign petitions to end this absurdity.,1) I found some legal documents that had my mother's name on them and asked her what they were about. She took them away and asked me to forget about them; and then when I continued asking questions I got the sense that there was something she didn't want me to know about. I then asked my father about them and he explained a complex personal situation to me. They both then sat down and told me the whole story and the circumstances about that event in my mother's past; where she was misused by another man before she met my father. So this was something they had hoped never to mention again; and it was something that changed the way I saw my mother at the time; only because it was a traumatic experience I had no idea she had been through it; and also because she felt the need to hide it from me. /  / 2) I felt hurt; betrayed; angry; horrified; confused and sick. I couldn't believe that I had only found out by accident and that they had concealed this from me and lied to me when I used to ask them questions about their lives. Then the very incident that she had been through seemed to become the most important and listening to her emotionally explain it to me made me feel nothing other than tenderness for her. She is in her 60s but I felt like I needed to comfort her; reassure her that of course I wouldn't think any less of her for a mistake that she did not make knowingly and for the hurt that was caused not by; but to her. /  / 3) What I wanted to do was never forgive them for hiding the information from me; for a number of reasons. What actually happened was a lot of crying and shouting on everyone's parts. In the end I tried to hug her but she didn't want to be touched; and although that hurt me as a child; I understood why.,1) When I was in India I would see families of homeless people living on the street; begging at the stop-lights; cooking food on paraffin stoves in the open; etc. /  / 2) Every time I saw these things I'd think about how little I could help; since I was very young at the time. I'd wonder how I would feel in their place and knew that I probably wouldn't have the strength they had. Then I would immediately feel grateful for all the things in my life I took for granted. /  / 3) What I wanted to do was get out there and help them; but I didn't know where to begin. In the end I would just discuss it with my parents and they'd tell me that they would continue to donate to charity and that as I grew older there would be more opportunities for me to actually help them myself.,1) This incident occurred last week; when I found my roommate crying about an exam grade. The subject was Organic Chemistry Part 1; a course I had previously taken and struggled with in much the same way; and so I instantly knew what she was going through without her having to explain it to me. Her situation was that her grade was so bad that nothing she could do for the rest of the semester would salvage it; she felt she might end up with a failing grade. She only needs this course as a prerequisite and has no actual interest in the subject; the same reasoning process I had used when I took it. /  / 2) What I felt was an instant need to get her to understand that her anxiety was normal and that this course is hard on everyone. I brought up my own experiences and remembered and recounted feeling like I wouldn't be able to do well; get a terrible grade on my transcript; get a low GPA; which would therefore get me fewer recommendations; fewer successful applications to summer programs; internships and jobs; which would in turn affect my income. In addition to all these concerns; I felt terrible for the issue that she brought up that I hadn't encountered yet: that she would have to drop the course and take it again; thereby prolonging her stay at the UM. She is already gearing up for her 5th year as a senior and the expense is taking a toll on her family that has already put 3 children through university. /  / 3) What I wanted to do was get her to stop feeling so hopeless. She mentioned that she had been crying for 4 hours before I came home; which made me extremely worried because when that has happened to me in the past; I have given myself migraines and a fever that take a few days to recede; and that would just compound her problems. What I said; was basically an account of my similar struggle through this course and my freak-outs at the same points in time. I told her what ended up working for me; because I actually did end up finishing the course with a good grade despite having done less than well on the midterms. I then asked her to walk me through her decision making process in terms of dropping it; because I felt that that might hurt her since one of her main concerns was delaying her graduation date. I then helped her reason through all the options and provided as many arguments for and against each one as I could think of; while letting her know that I would support her decision no matter what it was. I have also been helping her with her material throughout and I reminded her that she could come to me for more help with HW; etc any time.,,3,1,0,0,2,3,,,,1,,1,1,7,1,3,4,5,2,1,1,7,1,6,7,6,1,6,6,6,6,1,1,3,4,6,3,7,7,6,2,2,2,1. disgust / 2. disappointment / 3. anger,I wouldn't call pity a kind of love.,I think for this situation that it was true of the pity I felt.

3/25/14 16:59,3/25/14 17:50,415,0,0,0,0,0,0,One of my very good friends spontaneously broke up with his girlfriend a couple months ago and since has been struggling with the decision. Some days he wants her back; some days he doesnt; but he just keeps stringing her along. He seems genuinely confused and upset about the whole situation and while I don't think his intentions in breaking up with his girlfriend were to be mean or to hurt her; he did hurt her and he was mean. I think he's just genuinely clueless and dumb when it comes to women and dating. So I pitied him because even though he was sad and upset; he had brought it upon himself and he had the power to make the situation better. I told him that he had been an asshole to his girlfriend and that if she took him back I would be surprised; but that I liked them together and hoped one day they could work it out. He always asks me for advice and I give it to him but I don't like to him about the fact that he made a mistake and wasn't a nice person. I was sad for him that what he did caused him so much pain and stress but at the same time understood that he deserved to feel how he was feeling because his ex girlfriend probably felt even worse. ,A time that I felt tenderness was when I first met my knew baby cousin. He was so small and vulnerable and little and I felt soft and gentle and careful around him; like I had to be careful not to hurt him. I felt like he needed a lot of attention and love from everyone around him; including me. I held him a lot and have since babysat him a lot. He is now one year old.,When my mom's father passed away when I was in 10th grade in high school I felt a lot of compassion for her and all of my other aunts and uncles; and my grandmother. I just felt like I needed to be there for them. I didn't so much as feel bad for them; even though I did; but I also was sad to; so I felt compassion and a need to just needed to show them my love and support. ,A time I felt sympathy for someone was last fall. My friend and I were at a Halloween party and he had been acting strange and distant all night so I asked if he wanted to talk. We did and he started telling me about how his parents were filing for bankruptcy soon. I had no idea this was going on in his life and I didn't know how to help or what to say. I felt so bad for him because his parent's finances are completely out of his control; but obviously this would have a great effect on his life. I kept trying to assure him that it would be okay but it's not like I actually knew that. I just assured him that I was there for him to talk whenever he needed. I felt like I wished I could have done something but the situation was out of my control and there was nothing I could do to make it better; which made me feel even worse. I also felt like I couldn't relate to his situation since my parents have never gone through financial troubles like bankruptcy. I sympathized that his parents had to go through this.,What happened to make me feel empathetic was a situation between my sister and her boyfriend. My sister's boyfriend cheated on her with someone who he had said was just his friend. Later her boyfriend tried to explain and backtrack about the situation but then kept telling the other girl different things than he was telling my sister. My sister is good friends with her boyfriend's roommate; and the roommate sided with my sister; thinking that the boyfriend had been in the wrong. I empathized with my sister because I went through a similar situation. Someone that I was dating cheated on me with another girl that was supposedly just his friend; and I am also best friends with the guy I was dating's roommate; who sided with me and thought that I had been wronged. My sister and I went through almost exactly the same situation; which is why I felt bad for her and knew what she was going through; could relate to it; at the same time. When my sister was telling me about her situation I felt like I wished I could help her. I was feeling sad that the same thing had happened to both of us. I was thinking about how to tell her to leave her boyfriend and not take him back or let him  stay in her life when he had messed up so many times. I wanted to tell her to stop talking to him forever; but I told her to do what she felt was right for her because I didn't want to tell her what to do with her life. ,3,0,1,2,3,4,,,,,,2,1,,1,5,3,5,1,1,4,4,4,3,6,3,5,6,6,1,1,6,4,5,3,4,4,6,6,2,3,5,4,1. disappointment  / 2. conflicted / 3. ,Not,I have no idea what this means.,6,7,1,1,3,4,6,1,4,4,1,2,2,1,1,7,1,1,4,1,3,1,7,1,4,6,1,1,4,6,5,6,1. love / 2. gentleness / 3. supportive,Not,1,1,7,1,1,7,1,1,7,5,7,7,1,1,1,7,1,1,1,1,7,2,7,6,4,7,1,2,4,4,2,7,1. grief / 2. love / 3. ,true love,1,1,7,1,3,4,1,1,7,3,5,5,1,5,1,6,1,1,5,5,7,3,6,4,4,3,3,5,2,4,4,6,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,Not,1,1,7,1,4,4,3,1,6,6,,6,3,5,2,2,1,1,6,7,6,4,6,6,4,5,5,4,4,3,3,6,1. sadness / 2. helplessness / 3. ,Not

I felt this way because I had no control over the situation and that it was already over; that she was already dead and there was nothing anyone could do about it. I thought that it was so sad and unnecessary that she had to die. I forget the situation; but I feel like the problem could have been solved in a better way. After hearing bits of neighbors and a past girlfriend talking about him; I felt even worse for him because it all made it seem like he was guilty. I felt pity for him even though he committed a murder because he probably felt terrible about it now and wished so much he could do anything to undo it.,I felt tenderness when I played with my baby sister during her first months and year of her life. There's something about babies that make you feel good and tender inside. Her skin was so soft and her eyes so dark and clear. She was so innocent and cute; it felt like nothing could be wrong. Whenever I played with her; I was always careful to be gentle to not hurt her and to protect her from falling or playing with dangerous objects. She was so helpless; I felt that it was my job to help her. She could just be herself and make everyone smile and feel tenderness.,A time when I felt compassion towards someone was for my mom when my sister was born. We are almost 17 years apart and she is my only sibling. For the months and weeks before her birth; I had kept it a secret from even my closest friends. I told everyone the week before she was due and I think I did this because I was a little embarrassed but also felt that it was extra stress I didn't need during junior year of high school. Even though my mom was very tired all the time; she still kept on doing chores and cooking for us every day. I didn't feel bad; even though now I do for thinking that way. After my sister was born though; I felt that my mom was so brave and strong for having her. I felt like I had to do everything I could to help her out. I became much more loving and kind to her; helping her taking care of the baby and cleaning and cooking. I felt that it was my job to be understanding towards my mom and to help her in any way I could; even if that meant sacrificing sleep or time with friends or school work. / +,When the grandma of one of my friends from childhood passed away; I felt sympathy for her. I couldn't really relate to her because no one in my family that I am very close to has passed away in my life time. I knew she felt terrible because she loved her grandma so much and was very close to her. I knew her as well; and she used to babysit us when we were little. It happened so suddenly and so unexpectedly. I felt really sad just thinking about it. Even though we don't talk much anymore; we still see each other sometimes during school breaks; but the way I remember her feeling about her grandma makes me sympathetic towards her when she passed away. I can't even imagine how I would feel if one of my grandparents passed away; but I know it must be a terrible feeling.,I felt empathetic towards my roommate who tried very hard this year to get an internship for the summer but still hasn't found one. I felt like that because I also have been having a really hard time finding one. I totally could understand her situation. She was upset; nervous; and  worried that she wouldn't be able to find work this summer; especially since she needs to pay for her own tuition. I was especially nervous because as a junior this year; it's my last summer to get an  internship before trying to find a real job after graduation; it's so important because I've never had an internship before. Although she is still a sophomore and has some time; I absolutely know the sense of urgency she's feeling. When I talked to her; we discussed other options like doing research over the summer; and I gave her some advice on that since I've worked in multiple labs before.,3,2,0,1,3,4,,,,,,1,1,7,1,3,3,1,1,3,1,7,1,2,6,2,6,,6,2,2,6,4,2,4,1,1,4,4,2,4,1,5,1. sad / 2. angry / 3. ,a kind of love that recognizes what's right and what's wrong and is honest,Somewhat.

3/27/14 9:49,3/27/14 10:36,418,0,0,0,0,0,0,When I walk down State Street in Ann Arbor; I tend to feel pity towards all of the homeless people begging for money on the sidewalks. As much as they are looked down upon and ignored; I really pity them because they are just trying the best they can to stay alive and feed themselves and stay warm during the harsh winter months (and year-round). Once in awhile if I am feeling particularly generous; I will give my change to the homeless people I pass by; but that happens very rarely. I feel pity towards them because they seem to be stuck in their situation and deep down I wish I could help all of them; but I know that it's not possible and if they want to get back on their feet they should take control of their situation and try to find a job or another way to make money.,I felt tenderness when I was in my last relationship. I was with this guy for three years and I had grown to feel a lot of tenderness towards him. I had a deep urge to take care of him and keep him happy; which I would do by comforting him when he was sad or stressed out; and surprising him with things like gifts or dates when I was able to. I feel like our emotions were deeply connected because when he felt happy; it made me happy; and when he was sad it became my sadness as well. I would connect those feelings to the tenderness that I felt towards him because I truly cared for him and wanted to make him as happy as I could.,I feel compassion towards my patients when I am at work (a nurse assistant at a hospital). When I am at work and am taking care of my assigned patients; I truly feel compassionate towards them because I feel like it is my responsibility to take care of them and make sure they are comfortable. Hospitals can be scary; stressful places for patients and I want to do everything I can to help them during their rough times. I feel compassion because it makes my job worthwhile when I can make a patient smile or have them thank me and tell me how wonderful I have been to them.,I was in clinical one day (I am a nursing student) at the U-M hospital and I was in a patient's room with my nurse mentor helping pass medication. While we were in there; the patient's doctor and some other residents came into the room to speak with the patient. The doctor told the patient that her test had shown that her cancer had spread to her liver and there was scarring present. Because the women was elderly and already sick; the doctor felt that going through chemotherapy would not be beneficial because the cancer only had a 20% cure rate and it would just make the woman feel more sick without much benefit. They informed her that they would switch their focus onto palliative care in order to improve her quality of life and just do everything they could to make her more comfortable. The patient had tears in her eyes and was holding her husband's hand and did not appear to be listening very well - she was lost in her own thoughts trying to comprehend what the doctor had just told her. I felt sympathy for her because I didn't know how to relate to what she was going through and I wished there was something I could do to help her.,A friend of mine has been going through a breakup at the same time I have been; so we frequently talk with each other about our feelings and ask how we're holding up. I often times feel very empathetic when we talk because she will have rough days when she misses her ex-boyfriend and wants to get back together with him and she will tell me about those feelings. Although I no longer feel that way about my breakup; I definitely remember the feelings very strongly from just a month or two ago and can relate extremely well. Through my empathy I tell her that I know exactly how she feels and that the situation will improve because I went through it as well and it improved after time for me. I give her advice about how I got through it so I can help her get through it as well. My empathy by relating to the situation helps me talk to her and brings us closer as friends.,3,0,1,2,3,4,,,,,,2,1,7,1,1,7,1,1,3,1,3,2,4,4,4,5,4,4,2,3,5,3,3,4,2,1,4,3,3,3,1,4,1.

3/27/14 9:50,3/27/14 10:35,419,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,My grandfather was diagnosed with an advanced stage of cancer two years ago. My family had suspected this as we observed his deteriorating health and a visible lump which appeared on his temple area. When the news was finally out; my heart sank. I suddenly felt like I loved him even more; cherished him ever more greatly; and became fond of the many memories I shared with him as I was growing up. I felt helpless for sure; because there was nothing else I could do; but to spend more time with him during his dying days even as the situation got tougher with every week that went by.,"A classmate of mine had her dog run over in an accident by a moving vehicle just last week. As she was describing what had happened; I could also observe her beginning to tear up. At this instance; I felt sympathetic towards her. I did not know what to say; and I never had a pet getting into such an accident; or let alone a pet in a really long time. All I thought I could do was to sit there and listen and go ""I'm sorry to hear that;"" and that's what I did.",A classmate of mine was hopeful on getting into the Ross School of Business. Given his high GPA and active participation in co-curricular activities at school; he was confident that he stood a good chance. Unfortunately; his application was declined and he got really discouraged. I was filled with empathy because I knew what kind of feelings he was experiencing having been rejected from something he was very sure about. I told him to consider the Ross Business minor at the end of this sophomore year instead; or to apply for the Organizational Studies program.,3,0,1,2,1,0,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,7,1,3,7,1,1,7,7,7,3,1,1,1,7,1,1,1,1,7,1,7,7,2,7,2,1,1,7,7,7,1.

3/27/14 9:51,3/27/14 11:51,420,0,0,0,0,0,0," Last week I was walking down State street when I saw a women standing on the side of a building with a sign that said ""Single Mother. Need money for food. Any bit helps."" This is the first time I had ever felt anything toward a homeless person asking for money. Usually I just walk by ignoring them because half the time their stories aren't true. However; I felt pity for this woman because she had kids to provide for and she must have been so embarrassed to have to ask others for money. I wouldn't ever want to be in her position. She couldn't provide for her kids and as a mother; she's failing her job. I highly considered giving her money; but instead I kept walking. (I was followed by a homeless person once so I have a strict rule of not interacting with them anymore.) But I realized that her life must be very stressful; embarrassing; and that she was at her lowest point to have to ask others for money. I pitied her for the life she was stuck in and I pitied her kids for the life that they must be experiencing.",My brother had broken his arm several years ago from skateboarding in the rain. He had broken both bones in his arm and had to get surgery; which of course led to a long recovery process. Being an older sister; I felt the need to take care of him. Every day when he was watching television; I'd try to help in any way I could: bring him lunch; bring him water; play games with him; entertain him; and most importantly sooth him. I did all of this with tenderness because he was already in pain and I wanted to do anything I could in order to make him feel better. I wouldn't want to make the situation any worse so I took care of him. I'd frequently brush his hair out of his face with a soothing touch. I used a softer tone of voice. I tried to make him smile. I was nice to him. To me; this is what tenderness is all about. ,Last February; my current boyfriend; Jason; and I went to his family's cabin for Valentine's Day weekend. It was our first trip together. We have only been dating for 6 months so the car ride and the seclusion of the cabin really allowed for us to get to know each other a lot better. We learned many new things about each other and got to have a really fun get away from school. We made dinner together; watched some movies; went walking on the frozen lake. It was beautiful and very romantic.  I am in love with Jason and I therefore; obviously;  feel very compassionate toward him. I care for his well-being; I always want to be with him; close to him; experiencing new things together; etc. ,Recently; my father had to attend a funeral. It was for the man who saved his life. When my Dad was only 2 years old; he was in his basement and it exploded. A neighbor ran into the house and pulled my Dad out of the basement. Obviously; my Dad survived because I am here today; but it wasn't without burns all over his skin and countless surgeries growing up. Several years back; we got the opportunity to meet this man on his 70th birthday. He said he had always wondered if he had made the right decision by saving my Dad's life; or if his life would be worse with the future obstacle he'd have to overcome from being burned. However; after seeing my Dad with his family; he said he knew he had made the right decision and his mind was at peace. My dad and this man stayed in touch since then. My dad received a phone call two weeks ago informing him of the news. My dad went with my mom to this funeral for his friend; but also to pay his respects. How does someone say goodbye/thank a man for saving their life? This seems like such an impossible feet; and I felt so much sympathy for my dad. I know how hard it must have been for him to face that day; to see a man that we are eternally grateful for pass on. I can't imagine how difficult it must have been or how my dad was feeling. I was at school unfortunately; but I tried to send my dad comforting messages and phone calls to ease the struggle. With that being said; Thank you sir; for saving my dad. ,I am somewhat unclear what empathy entails. For this entry; I am operating under the assumption that empathy is when you can put yourself in someone else's situation and experience their feelings as well.  /  / Earlier this semester; a girl on my dance team opened up to me and told me that her boyfriend had recently broken up with her and that she was struggling with it. It was distracting her from her school work and practice and her head was all over the place. I took her out for coffee and was talked about it. I could relate to what she was saying because a year ago; my boyfriend of 2 years had broken up with me; and I had gone through many of the same emotions she was currently experiencing. I listened and let her get everything out of her system; and then tried to offer advice about things she was worried about by drawing from my own experiences. In the process; I remembered many of my old feelings of rejection and struggle; but I was also glad to not be feeling that way anymore. With this perspective; I was able to look at the situation objectively to try and help her. However; I could empathize with how crappy she was feeling because I know that feeling and it's awful. I wouldn't want that for anyone; especially my friend. ,3,1,0,2,3,4,,,,,,1,1,7,1,2,5,4,1,4,1,7,1,4,3,3,6,3,3,2,2,5,4,3,1,4,4,5,7,3,2,4,3,1. Guilt / 2. Sadness / 3.

3/27/14 10:31,3/27/14 11:54,421,0,0,0,0,0,0,I felt pity when I heard about a girl who several of my friends knew dying by being hit by a car earlier this year. I read articles about how her brother had also died in a similar kind of accident a few years earlier; and I believe she had one surviving parent. I couldn't help thinking how absolutely horrible it would be to lose two children years apart in the same way. It made me so very sad for them. The whole situation was just tragic; and made me angry that we live in a world where this happens so often.,I felt tenderness last week when I was out with my friends at this club by First and Huron called Live. I was there with a few friends who I had not seen in a while. I remember that my friends were just being so caring towards each other and reminiscing over memories they had together; and I just felt so moved by their love and affection for each other. I remember thinking that this is what gives me faith in humanity; that people can care about each other so much. Maybe a club was an odd setting for this to happen; but I think people's love for each other can come out in all kinds of situations. I think they were showing tenderness for each other; and I definitely felt tenderness toward them. It made me smile and I probably hugged them and maybe told them I loved them (I'm the kind of person who does these things regardless; so I'm not positive if I did these things this time but I'm sure I wanted to).,Compassion is the word that I have the hardest time defining because I think it is the most vague. However; I would call it compassion when I read blog posts by a friend's sister who is raising a child with a rare neurological disorder. I don't know the sister or her daughter; but I like reading about their lives and experiences. I sometimes feel sad or excited based on what she writes in the blog posts; and sometimes feel worried thinking about what I would do if I was in that situation. However; for the most part I feel considerable respect for what they go through and how they handle it; regardless of the fact that they handle some things in a very different way than I would (e.g. through religious involvement).,I felt sympathy for my mother; uncle; and aunts when my grandmother passed away this summer. I felt sorrow about it as well; of course; but to be honest we were never that close. However; seeing my grandmother's children remember her and mourn her passing evoked sympathy because I could understand their sadness and feel sad for them. I tried to be there for my mother as much as possible; and add my own memories in to show that she will not be forgotten.,I have felt empathy when one of my transgender friends talks about their experiences of discrimination or being triggered. One of my friends talked about feeling so upset by one of his professors that he was literally shaking. I think I was almost shaking when he told me about it; because I care deeply about him and I absolutely hate that he could be that emotionally hurt in a UM classroom. I imagined what he must have felt in that situation and felt upset and angry. I tried to be there for him by talking about how he felt and what his plans were going forward.,3,0,1,2,3,4,,,,,,1,1,7,1,2,4,1,1,2,2,7,2,1,7,2,4,1,1,7,7,7,2,5,5,4,2,2,1,7,5,2,5,1. Sadness / 2.

At some point three juniors on the team got in trouble for hazing and were actually arrested and expelled/suspended from the school. Two of the boys were well known around the school for being especially intelligent students; and they were also two of the top runners on the team. I think that one of the boys had an incredibly high GPA and was likely to be recruited by Princeton for track. I was not close to any of the boys so I did not doing anything about the situation; but because I knew about their stories I did feel some pity that their future's were basically ruined. I did not know the details of what happened in reality with the hazing.,"Several years ago there was a boy that I was talking to / getting close to etc. Over the course of only a few months I felt incredibly close to him and loved spending time with him. Very suddenly he stopped talking to me when he started seeing an ex girlfriend again; and we went months without talking. Finally we started talking again and hung out several times. I think that I would describe part of my emotions then as ""tenderness"" because the situation was like starting anew with an old situation. I had previously felt close to him and was sort of touching on this again? I felt very strange because I still felt like I knew him very well but I had not talked to him for a very long time; and his personality had also changed in many ways. ","My high school boyfriend and I loved to do all kinds of cool things together around New York City (where we grew up). I think that on each sort of ""adventure"" that we went on I would feel an especially high amount of compassion for him as we spent the day together. I guess one example is we walked over the Brooklyn Bridge and explored part of Brooklyn; went to a supermarket and bought cheese because we both love trying cool types of cheese; and then went out for a nice dinner. I felt very close to  him and just very comfortable and happy. / ",In my freshman year of high school my best friend's aunt passed away. Her aunt was middle aged and died because of cancer. She had two teenage children. My friend had never lost a family member before. I think I found out because she texted me or called me in the middle of the school day and I met her during a class and she was crying and I really did not know what to say to make her feel better. I think this partially stemmed from the fact that I had never dealt with this kind of situation before myself; and also just from the fact that no one ever really knows what to say when someone loses a loved one. I remember thinking that I wanted to be there for her and make her feel better yet at the same time I knew that I really could not make it any better; and I could just be there as a sort of presence so that she knew I was there. ,My friend from high school is a grade below me so he went through the college application process after I did. Several months ago he found out that he was deferred from one of his top choices. He was not totally devastated but it was the first college from which he had heard news; which just isn't a great way to start off hearing back from colleges. I felt empathy because I had gone through the same process before and had had to deal with some rejection from several colleges. This empathy meant that I felt like I could relate to him because of the shared experiences. Due to this empathy; I felt a responsibility to make him feel better about not being accepted.

I would feel tender towards my mom because i dislike when she does that. Even when she does it now i still feel tenderness. It the weird friction between the family and its when my dad and i are one side and my sister and mom are the other side battling against each other; but you try to stay together as a family; but you know no matter what dad will get the blame and never my mom. ,,Sympathy. I felt sympathy when  my dad's mother died. my dad would just sit there in a room alone and just start crying. I would walk into the room and know that he was crying but he wouldn't say a word. I felt so much sympathy. I knew i could not do anything to bring back his mother. Days went by where this happened day in and day out. Everything reminded my dad of his mother. I just sat there staring at him not knowing what to do feeling sympathetic. Its like the moments where you possible can not do anything to make somebody feel better. You are unable to fix the problem or help solve it so the only response is to be sympathetic. Seeing my dad stare at my grandma in her casket. with tears running down his face without effort. Just not knowing what to do but to cry with him and to be there for him. To see how much his mom meant to my dad. And to see how much pain my dad was in because of his grandma.,when  my sister finished both of her triathlon races i was so happy and actually started crying; and so did my dad.

We were all once very close but this roommate started to jealous of how close me and my other roommate were becoming and she felt as if she was getting pushed out and didn't like it. She was try to make us feel bad about leaving her out or she would try to include herself in situations when she wasn't invited in the first place. Neither me or my other roommate thought she was a bad person or felt like anybody deserved this; but she kept playing herself as the victim and wouldn't listen to any reason. I felt pity in one particular time when me and my other roommate when to a friend's birthday party where the old roommate wasn't invited to. She kept calling us and trying to see where we were and tried to get her boyfriend to find out where we were and come join us. I just didn't realize how desperate some people can be just to feel included even when they know that the aren't wanted in that particular situation.,One time when I was feeling tenderness was when my dad got sick really sick and eventually realized he had bronchitis. He lied in bed most of the time and barely could talk. I would help him out with whatever he needed and warmed up food and tea for him. I also knew my mom was stressed out with everything going on; like taking care of my dad and going to work so I tried to help out around the house as much as I could and didn't argue or yell with anyone so that it was a lot calmer around the house. I remember just trying to be soothing and comforting as much as possible.,One time when I felt compassion toward someone was when I was in a relationship with my first boyfriend in college. He lived in the dorm across the street from me so I would see him almost everyday and spend a lot of time with him. We aren't together anymore; but not because he isn't a great guy. He was always very sweet and kind to me and always put other people; not just me; before himself in all kinds of situations. I felt very compassionate towards him and the kind of personality he had. He would always be open to doing all different kinds of things; whether it be just sitting in bed and watching tv or going out to a party and hanging out with my friends even though he didn't really know any of them that well. One specific moment was when we were on our way to a party that one of my friends was throwing and towards the end of the night another one of my friends started to feel really badly. My boyfriend stepped up and took charge of the situation and really knew how to handle it when nobody else did. I saw that he really knew what he was doing and that he was a strong person.,,One time that I was feeling empathy towards someone was when the best friend of a close friend of mine committed suicide. My friend was really; really heartbroken over her loss even though that friend of hers had been having a lot of issues for a while and had been on a rough path for a long time. My friend was coping okay after a couple of days but I just felt bad for what she was going through because I know I would feel the same way if I lost my best friend in the same way. I wanted to be there for her but she kind of pushed me away and wanted her space so I gave her as much time as she needed until she was ready to talk to me. Eventually she did come and tell me how she was feeling and we talked it out which made her feel better and made me feel like I was able to help her out even a little bit.,3,3,0,2,1,0,,,,,1,1,1,6,3,3,2,3,2,1,1,5,2,2,3,3,7,5,5,2,3,4,2,3,1,2,1,5,6,2,4,1,6,1.

3/27/14 11:47,3/27/14 12:49,427,0,0,0,0,0,0,1) I felt a lot of pity towards someone once when I was at Cedar Point. A women who was very large was trying to get into the ride but she was not fitting and there was no way that she would be able to. She then had to get out of the seat; pretend to smile as if nothing was wrong; and leave her friends as they got to enjoy the ride.  /  / 2) I was feeling extreme pity for the woman because I felt so sad for her that she had let her own body get to that point. Although I didn't know the woman at all; I felt so sorry for her because I could only imagine the pain she was feeling from public embarrassment because of being too fat. I was thinking how sad it is that she was that large because I felt as if she couldn't have been too happy with herself and she couldn't have been very healthy at all and I really felt pain for her.    /  / 3) There wasn't anything I wanted to do because I didn't know the woman. I didn't do anything except feel sorry for her and I didn't say anything to her; except to my sister as I expressed my sadness and feelings of pity for the woman. ,,1) In a high school; a class mate of mine committed suicide. Although I didn't know her very well; I have always felt it is important to attend viewings and funerals. I went to the viewing and saw her parents crying. Her fathers face was very red and he had his head in his hands sobbing. I felt compassion towards him because although I could never know what he was going through; I felt so sad that he had to be going through this. I could feel his pain just by looking at him. I felt compassion for the girl's father and her family.   /  / 2) I deeply wished that there was a way I could make the family feel better but I didn't even know them so I knew I couldn't. I felt good that I was there to show support; but all I could was cry and feel so sad for the family and for what the girl must have been going through. I was probably crying more than anyone there. It was very painful for me to see the family so devastated.  /  / 3) I wished I could help; but all I did was offer my condolences; sit in the funeral home for a while; and talked to some of the family members of the girl. ,1) One of my best friends is frequently in a tough situation in that he doesn't get deserved help from his parents. One day he told me he was afraid of literally starving since he had to worry about paying bills and his parents were not helping him enough with food. This made me feel very sympathetic.   /  / 2) I was feeling very sad towards the situation and sad for him because I have always had the luxury of supportive parents who take their role as parents seriously. I felt desperate to find a way to help him and I also felt anger towards his parents. I understood the situation and all of its components and it made me even more sad to think about how deserving my friend was of more help from his parents.  /  / 3) I really wanted to help in any way I could. I gathered some extra food I had that I could definitely spare and I gave it to him. I continue to keep an eye out for any food I could offer to him. I told him that what is happening to him isn't fair and that he should always know that he deserves better than this. I made sure to tell him I loved him because I could only imagine the lack of love he felt due to his parents' neglect. I told him he would get through this and I would always be there to help and offer support. ,1) I felt empathy towards a friend of mine when they returned from a midterm exam crying. They had taken time to study for the exam and upon taking it; the GSI proctoring the exam started late and failed to give extra time to the students. This resulted in my friend not finishing the exam.  /  / 2) I was feeling very sorry for my friend because I know how stressful exams are and how frustrating it is to put so much time and effort into something only to come up short and because of unfairness. I could easily place myself in his shoes and understand why he was so upset.  /  / 3) I wanted to make him feel better but I knew there was not much I could do. I did; however hug and gave him advice. I told him to immediately email his professor to explain what happened. I told him I would also be upset in this situation and I stressed that I would explain the problem to the professor immediately because it was extremely unfair. ,3,3,0,1,0,2,,,1,,,1,1,5,1,1,3,1,1,1,2,6,1,4,7,5,3,6,7,3,3,5,3,3,3,1,1,2,3,2,5,1,4,1.

4/1/14 15:44,4/1/14 16:45,429,0,0,0,0,0,0,Once when I was biking home from swim practice; I saw a guy lying on the side of the road.  He was my neighbor; and pretty overweight; so I stopped and asked him if he was okay.  He was clutching his knee and couldn't really speak; so I called an ambulance. Meanwhile; I got a few of the older boys in the neighborhood to help lift him into the ambulance when it got here; and I kept talking to him to try to make him feel comfortable. Eventually the ambulance came and he was taken to the hospital; and when he came back; he had to be in a wheelchair for several weeks; but he was okay.  I think mostly; he was embarrassed that he couldn't stand up by himself; so I tried to be as respectful of him as possible when talking to him.,When my baby sister and I were little; we used to rescue animals all the time. Birds; frogs; cats; squirrels; and especially turtles.  Once; we found a squirrel that had gotten a wicked case of Mange; a type of bacteria that makes you lose your fur; so our mom brought some medicine home from work (she's a veterinarian) and we made some peanut butter balls with medicine inside for her to eat. The squirrel gobbled them right up! A few weeks later she had fur again and actually became a mom to three baby squirrels. :),Right before I walked into this study; a man was walking into East Hall before me; and he had a walker to help him walk.  I felt compassion for him; because he reminded me of my grandparents and how they struggle to do basic things in their old age; so I opened the door for him.  I think I mentioned something about the weather being nice out too.  I almost didn't help him; because I never know if helping people makes them feel inadequate or that they are incapable of helping themselves; but I opened the door anyway.,I took an alternative spring break trip this year to West Virginia and I was amazed by how much rural poverty there was.  We worked with a family resource center; which existed to strengthen the family unit.  They had lots of classes teaching young families how to properly discipline their children; and they provided meals from a meal kitchen.  I learned so much about different lifestyles from talking to these people.  The main thing I observed was that it seemed like people were trapped in their own situation.  Perhaps they had a kid when they were young; or an older family member needed to be taken care of at home.  I could sympathize with them; I could try to understand what they were feeling.,Last year; I found out a girl in my hall; we'll call her Nora; was cutting herself.  She gave me her knife to hang onto; so that she wouldn't hurt herself; but I knew that wouldn't be enough to stop her. so I told my RA; who told my hall director; who got her help.  I knew it wouldn't stop her; because sometimes when I used to get stressed; I would want to hurt myself too; but I got help.  I was worried that she would find out that I told on her and not want to be my friend anymore; but since then she's gone on anti-depressants and doesn't cut herself anymore; and she never found out that it was me who told on her. :),3,0,1,2,3,4,,,,,,1,1,7,1,2,5,4,1,3,2,4,2,1,3,1,5,4,4,4,1,4,4,4,4,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1. compassion / 2.  / 3. ,I think there is love in everything; but I'm not entirely sure how to describe it in pity.,I disagree.

She was filling out graduate school application; integrating into a new work environment; broke up with her boyfriend; got in a big fight with her parents; and was taking a rigorous class schedule all at the same time.   /  / 2. I felt bad for her because she is one of my best friends and was going through so many hard things all at once.

I was available for her to talk to me as much as possible and I stayed in with her many nights so that she wouldn't have to be alone and so she would not have to cry all by herself.  I told her that everything would work itself out and that she should make decisions that make her happy and not try to be a people pleaser all the time.  ,I felt tenderness when I met my baby cousin for the first time.  She had just turned 2 years old.  My family lives out of state so we do not get to see them that often.  I got to hold her and play with her.  She was a very sweet little girl and she loved to play with her toys.  I felt happy and also a bit nurturing towards her.  I wanted to stay and play with her for a long time and get to know her better.  ,I felt compassion when I asked two of my best friends to be bridesmaids for me.  They were so excited and had no idea that I was going to ask because it had been  a few weeks since my engagement.  I surprised them with new nail polish and candy; and a bottle of sangria.  I was feeling really happy about them being in my wedding and also about the fact that they had no idea what was coming but that I knew they would be excited.  ,I felt sympathy for one of my old middle school friends when he dad got into a tragic car accident and died upon impact.  I felt really bad for her because she was very close with her dad and she was also only 13 years old.  I did not know how she felt because I've never gone through that type of a situation but I was able to support her at the funeral and go over to her house to try and cheer her up.  We didn't really talk about it but I just wanted her to know that I was there if she needed me.  , I felt empathy for another person when I found out that; like me; they had a sibling die at birth/an early age.  This other person later become my fiance.  I felt like we had a common tragedy and that allowed us to in a way 'bond' over it.  We both felt sad about it but were able to be there for each other.

4/1/14 15:47,4/1/14 17:05,430,0,0,0,0,0,0,"When my best friend went through her first major break-up; I felt pity for her. She couldn't accept her boyfriend's decision; and kept getting drunk and banging on his door every night crying. I knew she was in pain; but I felt like she was acting irrationally. I think that's why I felt more pity than sympathy for her; because I felt like she was not handling the situation as best as she could have. I listened to her and felt compassion for her loss; but part of me felt above her because of the way she was acting. I wanted to tell her she had to ""buck up"" eventually and accept the situation; but I knew I could not tell her that. Instead; I talked with her through her feelings and emotions. ",I felt tenderness towards my Mom when she had her mastectomy due to breast cancer. I remember when she came home she was on a lot of pain medication and her arm was in a sling. Of course; she needed help around the house and she both looked and felt vulnerable. I felt tenderness towards her because of that vulnerability; and my voice reflected that tender feeling. When I spoke to her; it was in a more concerned and soothing tone than normal. I was very attentive to her symptoms; feelings; wants and needs during that time in a way that was uncharacteristic of our normal mother-daughter relationship. My mom is very maternal; but during that time I felt more like the maternal character because she was the one in need. I asked her consistently if I could do anything for her; and I cooked most of the food for the family during that week. I wanted to try to minimize her discomfort and do as much as I could for her. ,A friend of mine had a very troubled family life growing up. She told me that her mother stole her credit cards; maxed them one; and therefore messed up her financial aid situation for college. In order to get the financial aid she needed; she had to emancipate herself from her mother. She also stopped talking to her; and moved out to live on her own. When my friend told me this; I felt compassion for her because I realized she had to overcome so much. I was amazed by her resiliency; and felt I understood her a little better because I knew where she had come from. However; I knew that I could never really understand all that she had gone through with her family; and told her I couldn't imagine what I would have done in her situation. I felt like I wanted to help her in some way; though I knew I couldn't really. Overall I felt closer to her; and felt she was deserving of small favors here and there (rides places; etc.) because her life has been hard enough. I felt grateful for everything I have; and the fact that I have parents who I can count on. ,"Earlier this year; a good friend of mine's mother died. At the funeral; I remember looking at him and feeling intense sympathy for him. I kept thinking about how heartbroken he must feel; and how everything must remind him of his mother. I bought him and his family food; even though I knew small comforts wouldn't help the situation. At the funeral I hugged him and told him ""I'm so sorry"". I wanted him to know I was thinking of him; and that even though we hadn't been close in years; that he and his other old friends were here for him. After the funeral; I made sure to invite him places in order to include him and take his mind off of his loss; and regularly asked his close friends how he was doing. ",My boyfriend's ex-girlfriend died; and I felt empathy towards him as he was telling me the story of her death. He told me they were on vacation together; and when he woke up he discovered she had died in her sleep. He told me he reacted calmly; but hours later; the permanency of the situation sunk in and he felt out of control. As he was telling me this; I kept picturing the situation in my mind and imagining how I would think and feel in the same situation. I felt a sense of panic when thinking about it; and tried to fathom how he must have felt. As he told me about it; I mostly listened and asked questions to try to understand how he felt. On the inside; I felt sympathetic towards him and emotional. The next day; I cried thinking about what he went through. I kept re-living how I would have felt if one of my ex-boyfriend's had died; and I was there to witness it. While I felt very sad for my boyfriend; I also was amazed by his resiliency. ,3,1,0,2,3,4,,,,,,2,2,3,1,5,5,1,1,2,5,2,,3,6,4,7,,7,4,3,4,5,3,2,5,5,5,5,3,2,1,4,1.

4/1/14 15:47,4/1/14 16:47,432,0,0,0,0,0,0,I felt pity towards my boyfriend when he first told me about how he is not very close to his family. He told me that he has always felt like a bit of an outsider in his family; that they don't really understand him; and now he feels like he isn't close to them and cannot relate to them. He is not close with his brother as well (they hardly ever talk); which is something I really pity; because my brother is my best friend. My boyfriend does not enjoy spending time with his family; dreads vacations with them; talking to them on the phone; coming home to visit them; etc. and he does not see much wrong with it. He accepts that his life is that way and his family simply isn't very important to him. I pity him because I am very much the opposite; my family is incredibly important to me. I love them to the ends of the earth; and I love spending time with them. I have grown up being close to my parents and especially my brother; who I can barely go a day without talking to. I pity him because I feel as though he has missed out on so many beautiful experiences that I myself have experienced (and take for granted). I don't express my pity to him too much; because he does not think he deserves it; he does not think he is in a situation to be pitied.,,I felt compassion towards my baby brother when I saw him for the first time after he was born. I was 7.5 years old and I remember going to the hospital and holding him in my arms for the first time. My mom gently placed him in my arms and showed me how to hold him and I remember being astonished at how small and delicate he was. His eyes could barely open; everything was tiny; fragile; his head covered in soft wispy curls. I felt protective of this newborn human being; realizing that he was MY baby brother; I was his one and only older sister and suddenly I felt responsibility to make sure that nothing ever hurt him. I wanted him to love me someday as much as I loved him in this moment. I wanted us to be best friends someday. I touched his face (I had washed my hands carefully before holding him) and smiled to myself. I think I remarked on how cute he was; how small. My grandparents were there; along with both of my parents; and they chuckled quietly among themselves. But I remember feeling so grown-up all of a sudden because I was holding this fragile creature.,I felt sympathy towards my friend when her dad passed away. It was a terrible summer and he had gotten pneumonia and been hospitalized. Their family were close family-friends of my family; this friend is like a sister to me. When her father was hospitalized; that month was hell for all of us. We did everything we could to help their family; he fought long and hard; but his health ended up rapidly declining towards the end. I was devastated on the day that my mother quietly told me that the fight was over. I locked myself in my room and cried until my eyes could no longer produce tears. I was 15 and he was the first person I had lost who I had felt close to; this was really my first time experiencing grief. I felt sympathy towards my friend because I could not imagine what she was going through if I was having such a hard time. I could not imagine what it would be like to lose my own dad at such a young age (she was only 10 at the time). We went to their house that evening and I held her while she cried and I cried as well. Everything felt like a nightmare and I just wanted to wake up.,"I felt empathy towards my brother when he started crying after having a ""bad performance"" after a piano competition. He thought that he had played terribly because he forgot a part; even though I though he sounded fine and I knew that messing up was part of these high-pressurized situations. I also felt empathy because I knew what it was like to be in his shoes. I had had several piano performances throughout the 12 years I had learned piano; and the one that stuck out most to me was when I started crying after a concerto performance in Poland. I thought that I had sounded awful; that I hadn't been in sync with the orchestra at numerous parts of the piece; etc. Everyone told me I sounded marvelous; but I refused to believe them (much like what my brother was doing). I cried that evening after my concerto performance because I was so disappointed in myself; I just wanted one more chance to prove myself on that stage. My brother told me that he felt the same way. I told him about my experience in Poland; I told him I knew how he felt. I also made sure to tell him that after all my disappointment; I went and watched the video recording of myself and realized that I hadn't performed as badly as I thought I did. I told him that it always seems awful in that moment; but the truth is that he are all a little too hard on ourselves when we perform. I think he felt a little better after that.",3,0,1,2,3,4,,,1,,,1,1,7,1,1,7,1,1,2,3,5,1,2,6,2,4,4,4,6,6,5,3,7,5,1,2,7,5,3,5,1,6,1. helplessness / 2. lack of understanding / 3. sadness,I do not think pity is necessarily synonymous with love.,It might be true sometimes when you don't have a desire to help alleviate the situation the person you are pitying is in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,7,1,4,1,7,3,3,6,7,1,2,1,1,1,7,1,1,1,3,2,1,7,1,7,7,1,1,7,5,7,7,1. protectiveness / 2. joy / 3. awe,tender; caring love. the kind of love that makes you want to scoop someone up and make sure nothing ever hurts them.,1,1,7,1,1,7,1,1,6,7,7,4,1,2,1,7,1,1,1,1,7,2,7,7,7,7,4,5,6,7,4,7,1. grief / 2. pity / 3. helplessness,love that makes you want to carry some of their pain on your own shoulders so they suffer less,2,1,7,1,5,5,1,1,4,7,4,7,1,1,1,5,3,2,1,1,6,2,7,7,5,5,5,5,1,4,7,5,1. understanding / 2. responsibility / 3. caring,I-know-how-you-feel-because-I've-been-there love
4/1/14 15:50,4/1/14 16:51,432,0,0,0,0,0,0,I was on a bus the other day when I saw an old lady carrying two big plastic bags full of beverage cans and beer bottles. The bus was pretty full that time and it was really hard to move around with two such big bags. However; there was no one willing to stand up and gave his or her seat to this old lady. I took pity on her and decided to gave my seat to her seeing tha she could not even stand straight in the overly-crowded bus. It reminded me of my mother when I looked at the old lady and it upset me when I realized that there is no one willing to help at that point of time. I felt responsible to help her even though she had no relation to me. I imagined how would I feel if that lady was my mother carrying so much stuff without a single person willing to help her when she is in need. ,It happened a lot of times when I argued with my brother. He was always the rebellious one and would like to hold on to certain things that he thought and believed was correct. It was frustrating when arguing with him over certain things that was so minor. Once; he got on my nerves and we quarrelled over who should get in the backseat of a car first. After a few days of not talking to each other; I decided to inititate the conversation with him and at that moment I felt more tendered towards him; blaming myself for being too harsh at times and never consider his feelings. I swear to be a good sister thereafter.,When comes to compassion; I would think of my mother. She always serves as the inspiration to me and I look up on her in everything she does. In short; she is a  role model to me. The feeling of compassion towards her comes from the little things she does in her daily lives. She is a businesswoman and housewife at the same time and I could not understand how she could manage her time so well that she achieves success in her business without neglecting the family's welfare. She takes care of each and everyone in the family so well and yet she never complains about being tired or frustrated at times. When I am facing problems in friendship or in general relationship with people; she would always be there for me; listening to me and motivating me. I am so proud of having her whenever I need someone to talk to and seek for advices.,While I was traveling in Peru; I passed by a poor village in the rural area on my way to Machu Picchu. I spent a night in that village and while I was walking down the street near my hostel; I saw a little kid was picking something from the ground and put it into his mouth. I was so shocked because it looked like a trash to me and I ran forward to stop the kid from doing that. It was really hard to express what I wanted to say to that kid due to language barrier and all I could do was using my body language to tell him that he could not pick up anything from the street and eat it. I felt sympathy to this boy seeing how hungry he was that he picked up anything he could find on the street and ate it. Eventually; I went to buy some food for him and asked him to go home as soon as possible since it was near midnight that time. It was my first time dealing with such situation seeing how poverty could affect a person so much.,My friend told me that she is in depressed because she just broke up with her boyfriend. The reason that they broke up being that the guy thought that both of them have a very different personalities that the communication gap between them got bigger and bigger over time. After listening to that; I felt the same as my friend due to my past experience. The bad memories of my past relationship flashed through my mind and I could not stop but being emotionally affected. However; I told my friend how I overcame my sadness and let her know that each and everyone of us is unique and thus if something do not work out; we should move forward in search of the right person. ,3,0,1,2,3,4,,,,,,1,1,7,1,2,5,5,4,1,5,7,1,2,5,1,5,1,4,4,4,7,2,7,1,7,7,5,2,7,7,3,7,1.

4/1/14 16:47,4/1/14 17:32,433,0,0,0,0,0,0,I felt pity for my neighbor when she lost her three babies. She was about 5 months pregnant with triplets and was so excited to be pregnant. She went in to labor at 5 months and they could do nothing to stop the labor; so she gave birth to her three babies; all under one pound. Each baby was born alive; but within the first 24 hours they all died. I heard about the situation in an email from the mom's mother the day after the incident. I felt so incredibly sorry for this woman and her husband. I can't imagine what it would be like to lose your child; let alone three of them in one day. She was so excited to be a mom and in a span of 24 hours that was taken away from her. They even named the children; but then had to bury them all. So incredibly sad. ,I felt tenderness towards my sister when she found out she didn't get into the college she wanted to get in to. I knew the situation was a big disappointment to her; and what she needed was some encouragement and love. I knew that it would have been awful if i was in her place; and I would want someone to be sweet to me; so that's how I treated her. In that moment; she only needed kind words; and nothing mean or rude. ,One time i felt compassion for the campers that were in my cabin this summer at camp. I was a counselor at a special needs camp in Missouri and over the summer I had campers with varying disabilities and varying ages. To me; compassion is a mixture of sympathy and love towards someone or something. Compassion compels you to act and to love on that person. Many of the campers at camp needed help with something such as dressing; getting ready for the day; eating; bathing; etc. Their disability and sweet hearts caused me to want to take care of them and have compassion on them by loving on them. ,I felt sympathy towards my neighbors family when they found out their father had Cancer again. He had battled brain cancer earlier in his life; and now he is married with three children and the brain cancer came back. I felt really sad for their family because I knew it must be so difficult to go through something like that. The kids didn't even know what Cancer was; they only knew their father was really sick. I knew if my dad was really sick like that I would have worried so much about him. I also love my neighbors family very much and had to watch them go through this hard time and it was so hard not to be able to do anything to solve it or fix the father. Prayer was all i could do. ,When my friend tore her ACL playing soccer i felt empathy towards her because a few weeks earlier I had done the same thing. I knew she would be going through the same process as me and that this would be a very hard time for her. I knew that soon she would have surgery like I did and it would be frustrating and painful; but that it would get better. I wanted to encourage her because I knew how she was feeling and I knew what I would have wanted to hear in that situation. ,3,0,1,2,3,4,,,,,,1,1,7,1,1,6,1,1,7,4,7,5,1,1,3,7,1,1,1,1,6,1,6,6,3,2,2,2,6,6,1,6,1. sadness / 2. sympathy / 3. ,I do not consider it a kind of love. ,No; I felt pity because I felt so bad for her situation; not because I disliked her in any way. ,3,2,6,1,5,3,5,1,4,5,3,5,2,5,2,5,6,6,5,5,5,3,5,5,5,4,3,5,3,4,5,5,1. kindness / 2. love / 3. gentleness,I think it's a sweet kind of love; a comforting kind of love.

This made it obvious that she had skipped the last class. Everyone recognized the topic and just kind of sat there; murmuring to each other about what was happening. I felt SO BAD for her and pitied that poor girl standing up there with everyone making comments to each other about her presentation.,,Sometimes; my mind wanders and I think about what life would be like without my dad.

I feel sympathy for her because I don't think she deserved this hardship and pain and wish she was in higher spirits. I feel like there isn't much I can do to make her feel better.

He told that there was a blogger who wrote an article bashing the event; even though most people who knew about it on campus were excited. He told me that it was really upsetting to have people out there who speak so negatively about something that other people had worked hard for and wouldn't let something positive just happen. I understood what he meant since I had planned a service trip this Spring Break ; and; although it went amazingly well; a few people still were negative about it for stupid reasons. I could understand how he felt and wanted to be supportive since I remember wanting some support when I felt that similar feeling. I told that there are always people like that and not to let them bring him down. I really wanted to be more help; but I feel that I couldn't do much more.

4/1/14 16:51,4/1/14 17:25,435,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,I felt compassionate towards one of my middle school friends whose father had passed away suddenly.  She was a girl in my grade and we were all part of a pretty big group of friends.  Her dad coached the 5th/6th grade basketball team while I was on the 7th/8th grade basketball team; so I wasn't really too familiar with him from in that way.  I had met him before at her birthday party earlier that month; so it was weird to think that he was no longer living.  I remember feeling really sad because I tried to put myself in her shoes; how I would react/feel if my father had suddenly passed.  I felt like I wanted to bring him back somehow; as she was only 12-13 at the time.  I thought about how he wouldn't get to see her or her younger brother grow up and have families and be there for his grandkids.  I tried my best to be compassionate; but when it comes to death; I felt that there is only so much words can do.,A time when I felt sympathetic was when I was walking down State Street.  There's always a bunch of homeless guys there and I always feel really sympathetic because I don't know how they live that way.  I know I couldn't do it; especially when it was particularly hot or cold outside.  But at the same time; I always remind myself of the numerous reasons why they're in their situation... Maybe they got mixed up with drugs; alcohol; or gambling.  Maybe they did something (that could have been avoided) and put themselves in their predicament.  They're situation may not be as innocent as they make it seem.  Of course there's a small part of me that wants to give them money to help them out; but then I always hear about how people beg for money claiming to use it towards food/warm clothing/for their families etc; but then go ahead and use it to buy cigarettes; drugs/alcohol; or to gamble; all things that the donor did not intend for that money to go to use for.,,3,0,1,0,1,0,1,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,7,1,1,7,1,1,4,5,6,3,1,2,1,6,2,2,1,2,7,2,7,4,7,7,1,1,3,4,1,7,1.

4/1/14 17:12,4/1/14 18:03,437,0,0,0,0,0,0,I remember feeling pity when my close friend told me that he did poorly on the previous organic chemistry test. He got a 60 percent or something close to that. My close friend works very hard; much harder than me. But I did much better than him on the test.  He teaches me the material taught in lecture very often. I felt pity because I thought that he deserved a much higher grade for all the effort he put into the test (he had gotten above 90 percent on all the tests prior to this one.) I also felt pity for him because I knew how important grades are to him; so getting a bad grade is pretty tough to take. I remember thinking that he was way to smart to not do well on the next tests; so I told him that. I also told him that the test was extremely hard and his grade was still significantly above average; so it would not be too difficult to manage an A for the class. I didn't talk about my test because that wouldn't help the situation. I remember watching his face to see if he was disappointed; defeated; or positive. The main emotion that I saw was determination to do better on the next tests. ,,,I felt sympathy toward my golf coach when he said he was and still is going through tough times because his daughter had not been in good health for quite a while. The people involved were the 6 varsity members of my high school golf team and my coach. After not making in to the state championship; out coach said he was bummed; but that he could not be more proud of the team's effort that we put forth all season. He admitted that it was very difficult coaching the golf team and taking care of his daughter at the same time. What made me feel sympathy was his honesty and willingness to open up about a topic that is very touchy and difficult to talk about. He is normally a very composed and often; harshly blunt in his methods of communication; so it was very different to see him show his true emotions. Also; he started to tear up; which made me feel sympathy. I felt sympathy because I understood what he was going through; as my aunt is also not in the best of health. When my aunt first became ill; my mom went through the same thing. It was hard for my mom to manage everyday tasks; like her job; while also taking care of my aunt's healthcare situation. My mom; a very strong woman; has a personality much like my golf coach; and they both acted similarly in their respective situations.  /  / I remember saying to my golf coach that everybody on the team was there for him and we would support him no matter what. Everybody on the team chimed in. I remember that i couldn't see my coach's face; as he was driving the van back home and I was in the backseat. All i could hear was his voice; which changed and cracked as he started talking about his daughter. I felt sympathy at this time because his voice showed his true emotions. I also remember the faces of my teammates. They all looked shocked and sad at the same time. Usually a loud; comical bunch; we were all taken aback. Seeing my teammates faces made me see how real my coach's situation is; which made me feel sympathy. I remember being somewhat surprised to see my golf coach open up like he did; so it took me a couple of seconds to think of something to say. There wasn't much else that I could say because it was essentially my coach's post-season speech. I wanted to pat him on the back or something along those lines; but we were in a van and I was in the backseat while my coach was driving. My coach continued on by talking about the positives of the team; which made me feel sympathy because it seemed like he was trying to change the subject from himself to the team; which is a very selfless thing to do.,This is not a very strong feeling of empathy; but this example; to me; is the exact definition of empathy. This situation happens many times. Every time someone hurts their foot; ankle; knee or leg in a game of pickup basketball; I understand exactly how they feel and the pain that they are in. The most recent time that this situation occurred was this weekend. A very tall; heavy guy jumped onto a smaller guy's back by accident; then the smaller guy collapsed under the larger guy. The smaller guy was grabbing his knee and was writhing in pain on the floor of the basketball court. I could see the guy's clenched teeth and red face as he was trying to fight back the pain. He was also hitting the floor. This made me feel empathy because I have sprained both ankles several times each while playing basketball. Every time this happens; I do the same thing. I try to fight back yelling at the top of my lungs and slamming the floor. The pain is always much; much worse than someone would imagine. I remember that my body was shaking after the few severe sprains. I understood the pain that the smaller guy was feeling and how disappointing it is to be in crutches and being unable to walk for up to a week. I did not say anything or do anything because I was simply watching the basketball game; waiting to play in the next game. When the smaller guy got hurt; I thought about the sprained ankles and the pain that I described before. I knew that nothing that I could say or do would help the smaller guy; so I didn't do anything (other people already ran to get ice). ,3,2,0,1,0,0,,1,1,,,1,1,5,2,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,1,3,3,3,2,4,3,2,2,2,2,3,4,3,2,3,3,1,3,4,3,1.

4/8/14 15:52,4/8/14 16:45,439,0,0,0,0,0,0,My best friend got an MIP when we were freshmen in college; and even though we did drink underage regularly; the moment she got an MIP; I don't think she was at fault. It was a football tailgate that she had decided not to drink at that day; because she had to work later on. Another friend asked if she could hold his beer bottle while he did something; and at that point in time a cop came up and wrote her an MIP. Even while he was writing her one; a drunk girl behind him threw a beer bottle at the cop; and he decided to do nothing about it. She was truly in the wrong place at the wrong time; and I don't believe it was fair. I felt bad because she had to wake up at 5 am for the next couple months and couldn't drink for upcoming occasions.,A family friend; who was also my dance teacher; I had known for 18 years. She was very close with my entire immediate family and when she developed cancer; we were all very saddened by it. IT happened very quickly and she passed away only months after being diagnosed. When my sisters; Mom; and I attended the funeral; we were all sobbing uncontrollably and hugging each other.,My roommate is a graphic design major and works extremely hard; all the time. She is constantly stressing herself out; staying up late; and running around to meet deadlines. She's constantly been stressed out lately about her final senior projects being due and about finding a job. Her final project was chosen as a finalist for a class competition; and she got hired  by a company solely for her work; as they had seen that it had improved since the year before. I was extremely proud of her.,I have a roommate whose dad passed away about two years ago. When he died; I wasn't that close with her; but I understood that he had had melanoma and had tumors in his brain; making his last couple months extremely painful. Even though I wasn't close with her then; I still attended his wake service and found myself trying to extremely hard to fight back tears. I had never met him; but the place was packed and there were flowers everywhere. I could gather that he was an extremely popular man. Now that I'm much closer to my roommate; I always feel very sympathetic about some of the things she says about her dad; or even seeing the tattoo she has in remembrance of him. Sometimes I don't know how to act; or even wonder if bringing up stories about my dad in front of her would be considered inappropriate. It breaks my heart any time she mentions him though.,My roommate has always been very concerned about living far away from her parents because if they were to ever get sick; she wouldn't know how to deal with it from a distance. One day she came home crying and she told me that her dad had fainted and they had to rush him to the hospital. I felt extremely bad for her because I know it's something she constantly worries about anyway; so her state of mind was very frantic. There was not much I felt I could say to try to ease the situation; because when someone gets sick; it can be extremely difficult to verbally deal with. I felt frantic as well because she was just sitting in my bedroom crying and trying to decided if she should make the four hour drive home or not that day. ,3,0,1,2,3,4,,,,,,1,1,7,1,6,2,1,1,4,3,6,7,1,5,2,3,3,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,1,1,2,7,2,1,1,5,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,I would maybe call pity love in regards to it meaning not enjoying seeing another person upset or in a bad situation.,No,1,1,7,1,1,7,1,1,7,5,7,7,1,1,1,7,1,1,1,1,7,5,6,7,2,3,1,5,1,1,1,6,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,Tenderness is a kind of love dealing with sharing emotions,6,7,1,1,4,4,1,1,1,4,1,4,1,1,1,1,7,7,2,2,2,7,3,6,1,1,1,5,1,1,1,5,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,I think compassion is a type of love dealing with others' happiness,1,1,7,1,1,7,1,1,7,4,7,7,1,1,1,6,1,1,1,1,7,5,5,6,1,1,1,2,1,2,1,7,1.

4/8/14 15:53,4/8/14 16:42,440,0,0,0,0,0,0,One of my close friends; a female; was in a secret relationship with another female. My close friend was not comfortable sharing her feelings; and was not able to be open about this relationship. The girl that she was in a relationship with was very comfortable with these feelings; and wanted to share them publicly. My friend was not able to even tell her closest friends about the feelings; and secret relationship; that she was having. I felt pity towards my close friend. I pitied her because she was not able to be comfortable with who she is; not even with her closest friends. She was pretending to be someone she wasn't; and was; in return; just hurting herself and her emotions. I thought that it was really upsetting that she was so uncomfortable with such a thing; knowing that I; and her other friends; would fully support her; and for that I pitied her. I wanted to tell her to just be open about it; and to tell people. I did tell her to do so; but she refused.,I time when I felt tenderness toward someone was when my sister's cat died. The cat's death didn't directly affect me much; but it definitely affected my sister; and it made me feel very tender. She was so visibly upset; and it was hard to watch. I wanted to hold her in my arms and tell her that everything would be okay; but she just wanted to be alone. I told her that things would turn out okay; and that her cat loved her a lot and was happy and safe wherever it was now.,I was at a school talent show; where many of my friends were performing. They had practiced a lot and had to perform in front of over 2;000 people. While they were performing; I felt very compassionate. For them to be able to do such a thing made me feel a special way; and made me view them all differently. I bought them all flowers and told them how amazing they all were and cheered for them very loudly. I made sure that they knew how much I cared for them.,Two of my friends tried out for a school play; and I was able to watch the callbacks. They both got called back for the same role. During callbacks; one of my friends; I'll call her friend #1; performed significantly better than my other friend; friend #2. Friend #2 ended up getting the role. Once the cast list was announced; my friend #1 was very upset and felt as though she had done something wrong. I told her that she had not done anything wrong; and that I had seen it with my own eyes; and she deserved the role; not friend #2. I felt a lot of sympathy towards her. It was not fair that she had not gotten the role; and it was not fair that she was so upset over it.,,3,0,1,2,3,4,,,,1,,1,1,7,1,5,5,3,2,6,5,2,4,4,2,2,4,2,3,2,2,5,2,2,3,4,4,4,3,4,4,3,3,1. sympathy / 2. sadness / 3. frustration,I would not call pity a kind of love.,In some cases; yes.

4/8/14 15:53,4/8/14 16:39,441,0,0,0,0,0,0,I'm from a big city; and there is one homeless man that's always sitting on the same street corner on a box. One day when I was in a particularly bad mood; he asked me for change as usual; and I felt that doing something nice that day might cheer me up. Instead of giving him change; I walked past him to the pizza place and bought him a couple of slices. When I gave it to him; he was not grateful; he seemed merely confused and a bit irritated. He asked me if I had any money. He did not even thank me. I felt pity toward him because this told me a lot about his homelessness. He was not grateful at all for food; which shows that he did not want the money to buy himself a meal; but to buy something else; likely drugs or cigarettes; which made me feel terrible for him and his situation; which must be extremely difficult.,When I was 16 my at the time boyfriend and I went back to his empty house after prom to have sex for both of our first times. It was extremely awkward physically; but we cared about each other so much that somehow the situation didn't feel awkward. It really hurt and it was terrible. However; afterward; we both thought that it was still a really positive experience because we somehow felt a lot closer to each other. No one got really hurt physically or emotionally; and we were both really glad that we chose to do this with each other; because had it been someone we trusted less; it could have been potentially really awkward and traumatic. We sat in his car talking for a long time after; and I felt very trusting and gentle toward him; because I was grateful that this had not been a bad experience and that I was with him. ,When I was going into my freshman year of high school; my best friend and I were hanging out after he had gotten back from summer camp for the last couple of months. We spent the whole day catching up on things; and just as I turned to leave to walk home; he stopped me and told me he had to tell me something. He took a deep breath and told me that at camp he realized he was gay. This was the first time he had talked about it openly; and although he was ready to share it with me; he was not ready to share it with the rest of his friends or his parents. He seemed decently comfortable and confident in this realization; but also very scared about how this would impact his life. I somewhat understood what he was going through; but everyone's coming out experience is extremely different; and I offered to help him in any way possible through his journey. I felt very proud and very close to him; but also felt sympathy toward him because I know that this is a difficult process. I told him that I supported him and that I wouldn't tell anyone; and that I was here for him if he ever needed anything; and that I was very grateful that he trusted me with this information.,When I was in 6th grade; both of my mom's parents died within 11 months of each other. I had never dealt with the loss of a family member before; and had no conception of what her grief must have felt like; especially since I was only 11 years old. My grandparents were extremely old; and though I mourned their loss; I didn't know them well; as they had little ability to communicate in their older years when I remembered them. Therefore; I could not understand at all what my mom was going through; but I deeply felt for her and wanted to help her. My brother and I spent a lot more time with her that year than we usually did; and we tried to do anything we could to help her through the situation. I wanted to make her feel better; but knew that she didn't want to place the burden on us; and also that we couldn't understand what was really happening with her emotionally. ,My boyfriend's mom is in prison for shooting his dad when my boyfriend was in 9th grade. When he was in 11th grade; he received a letter from her; and it was his first time hearing from her since it happened. He told me about it after school; and said that the letter said that his mom thought he was turning into everything she hated about his dad. This really affected him and it was the first time I'd ever seen him truly shaken emotionally. Although I could not relate to the severity of the experience; I empathized with feeling like; or being told; that you are a disappointment to your parents. I felt truly powerless and devastated that he had to go through something so horrible; and then have his mom insult him after she was the one who committed such a terrible crime. I tried to just listen to him and ask him if he needed anything; because that was pretty much all I could do at the time to help him out.,3,0,1,2,3,4,,,,,,1,1,6,1,2,3,2,2,3,1,4,1,3,2,4,5,3,3,4,4,7,2,3,3,5,1,4,6,5,5,1,5,1.

4/8/14 15:59,4/8/14 16:35,442,0,0,0,0,0,0,"A few weekends ago I was volunteering at an all-day volunteer day in Detroit with fellow University of Michigan students. My group's assignment was to clean up a neighborhood garden of debris in order to make the neighborhood look more appealing and encourage people to keep it that way under the broken window theory. While I was working at the edge of the park kind of away from some of the fellow workers; a man from the neighborhood; clearly drunk; came up to me and asked if I had any money to spare. I said ""No; I'm sorry"" in the nicest way possible. I said no both because I did not have money on me and because I knew that he would only use it to buy himself more alcohol; though what he needed was a nice meal or warmer clothes. However; I said it in the nicest way possible because I did feel bad for him. Though it was probably his decision to pick up the bottle in the first place; alcoholism is a disease which led me to believe that he had enough problems without a student talking down to him or being rude to him when he needs help the most.",,The most recent time - and therefore my most vivid memory of - when I felt compassion for someone was last week when I was watching a movie for my spanish class called Baja la Misma Luna (Under the Same Moon). It was a story about a mom and son who had been separated for years because the mom had illegally crossed the border from Mexico into America to work to earn citizenship for her son. These two were only able to communicate during these years pay payphone for five minutes every Sunday while the mother worked three jobs to earn the money to pay a lawyer. These two faced many hardships; first; the mother had earned enough money to pay a man who claimed he was a lawyer when in reality he was just scamming her. Then; the son's grandmother; who had been his guardian while his mother was away; passed away. So; the son had to sneak across the border because he didnt have family left in Mexico to take care of him besides his aunt and uncle who just wanted to take care of him so that they could receive the checks his mother sent monthly. Then on the road to Los Angeles; where the mother was; he faced drug addicts; deportation; and lost his traveling money. All I wanted to do was reach in there and help him; give him some money and help him find his mom. Luckily; in the end; the two found each other.,,,3,0,1,1,1,1,,,1,1,1,1,1,7,1,3,6,3,1,1,2,4,2,2,2,6,7,6,6,2,2,4,2,4,2,2,3,7,7,2,3,2,5,1. sympathy / 2. empathy / 3. tenderness,No; I would not call pity a type of love.

I think compassion comes from understanding another person's situation and feeling toward that situation and wanting to do whatever you can to help the situation or help them feel better because you know that you would appreciate the help if you were in their situation. It means respecting every person and holding them equal in importance to yourself because you are both human; not different due to racial; socioeconomic; etc. reasons.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4/8/14 15:48,4/8/14 16:47,443,0,0,0,0,0,0,I felt pity towards my sister when she got into trouble at school. She had wrongfully been accused of cheating on a test. I felt pity because I knew what had happened wasn't right and I felt powerless in the situation. I kept thinking that there must have been something I could have said to the teacher or principal but I didn't know exactly what I could say to persuade them otherwise. ,I felt tenderness towards a baby that I was babysitting. The baby looked so fragile and helpless; so I was very gentle and calm in her presence. I was feeling that I needed to be very cautious so that I didn't cause any harm to the baby. I felt almost afraid because I knew that one wrong move on my part could really injure the baby. I also didn't want to negatively contribute to any developmental problems the baby may be able to have from being in my care. I wanted to play with the baby and make her laugh; which I did. I tried to tickle her and play peek a boo. Other times when I tried to play with the baby; she would scream. I think I felt tenderness because babies cry at little things and since they can't communicate; I have a hard time reassuring myself that I'm doing everything okay. ,I felt compassion towards someone when I worked in Detroit for a food bank service day. I didn't actually meet anyone who was homeless or in need of food. From prior experience to encountering or hearing about homeless people; it was not hard to imagine what the circumstances were like. I felt like I was very fortunate and that I could use that good fortune to help others in need. Everyone should have access to food; and I feel compassion towards those who do not. What I wanted to do was work as efficiently as possible to gather as many bags of food that would be distributed to the hungry. I wanted to genuinely work my hardest and produce a successful outcome. What I did was suggest an easier way to organize how the bag would be put together by the group of volunteers I was with. This led to more efficiency. ,I recently felt sympathetic when my grandmother's friend passed away. I felt sympathy for the family that was grieving. The main reason I felt this way was because I associated my grandma's friend as being somewhat like my actual grandma. The lady died of illness; so it was not a shock to the family and in a way it was kind of expected. Although my grandma is getting older; I felt sadness for the family based on the sadness I would feel if my grandma had passed away; regardless of the reason. I was thinking that my grandma could be the next person that I know that dies and I wanted to make sure I spent as much time with her as I can in the future. We always had a great relationship and it continues to get better each time I visit home or  talk with her over the phone. When I was at the funeral; I wanted to just be as supportive of the family as I could. The best way that I could do that; and did do that; was by making sure my grandma was at the funeral. My grandma is a good friend of the family and her absence would have been noticed. So; I felt that even if I couldn't really talk to the family that was grieving; since I didn't know them that well; I was being supportive since I made sure my grandma was there. ,I felt empathetic toward my boyfriend when he had a big assignment that was due the next day. I always tell him how he needs to stop procrastinating and that he always ends up in the same situations because of his own doing. I wanted to just hug him and tell him that everything would be okay. I always say that I'm going to not help him or feel bad; but it always ends up happening anyways. I ended up helping him and proofreading part of the assignment so that he would feel less stressed about the whole situation. ,3,0,1,2,3,4,,,,,,1,1,7,1,3,2,5,1,1,6,6,6,1,1,1,4,2,2,5,4,4,4,3,6,4,5,5,2,6,2,5,5,1. anger / 2. helpless / 3. ,I wouldn't call pity a type of love.,No; I do not think this is true,3,2,6,4,3,3,7,6,1,2,6,3,5,1,1,6,1,1,1,1,3,6,7,1,5,7,1,1,4,7,6,6,1. fear / 2. uneasy / 3. ,Tenderness is a kind of love that is very respectful with regards to boundaries and limits. ,4,1,7,1,2,3,5,3,3,3,5,2,5,3,4,5,2,3,3,3,6,2,5,1,4,4,4,4,6,3,2,5,1. hope / 2.  / 3. ,Compassion is a temporary type of love that hits only certain people... people that genuinely care about the well being of others.,1,1,6,1,4,3,1,1,2,4,5,5,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,5,5,6,2,3,3,3,1,1,1,4,1. sadness / 2. worry / 3. ,It would be a kind of love that is short-lived but very genuine at the time of occurring ,1,1,7,1,3,3,2,1,1,5,6,5,5,6,4,1,6,7,2,2,4,6,1,5,2,1,7,7,1,1,2,1,1. frustration / 2. worry / 3. ,I think this type of love would be temporary; but recurring

Thankfully everyone was okay but it was a scary experience at the time being woke up at 2am with the alarm going off and not being able to find the girls who had the room the fire started in.

I just wanted to do what I could for them during this trying time. It was amazing how greek life; and the rest of our sisters; were so supportive and helpful during this time. Donating their time; money; clothes; whatever they could need to help make their situation less stressful. They even had school and exams during this time! We are all grateful that they are okay but it was still hard to see what they had to go through compared to the rest of the house. ,"The experience that I thought of involved my mother. Her and her long time boyfriend were going through some tough times and it was really taking a toll on my mom. The thing is he kept pulling this shit with her. He would say things like he loves her but he is not ""in love"" with her and he's just not happy with himself and feels like he doesn't deserve her. Honestly I think my mom could do better but that is besides the point. I remember her crying to me on the phone and being so upset and there was nothing I could do. I would try to say things to make her feel better but what are you suppose to do when your parents are the ones that are crying to you? They are the people who are there for you when you are like that. It was really hard to see my mom like that; especially thinking of all the things she's done for me and I didn't know how to help her get through it. I really felt what she was going through and it was even harder because it was my mom. I'm normally an empathetic person even with strangers I do not even know. But with my mother the emotions were may more intense. ",2,0,1,1,2,0,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7,7,1,4,1,3,5,3,1,7,1,3,1,1,1,7,5,5,1,1,7,1,7,5,1,4,1,1,1,1,4,1,1. Happiness / 2.

When it came to the exams she would always under perform compared to her expectations; after studying for weeks at a time. Every time I would pity her because it just seems like she could never be satisfied with her abilities and always comparing herself to others. I would always want to tell her that its silly and that she should just focus on doing her best and also use her time to enjoy her self,I felt tenderness towards my 4 year old cousin. When I was taking a nap he came to lay down next to me cover us with a blanket gave me a kiss and fell asleep right next to me. when I looked at him I felt tenderness because of how nice and genuine what he did was. All i wanted to do was just pick him up and hug him; to express my emotions towards him but I couldn't wake him up so I instead took a picture of him and told everyone of how cute he was.,When I was volunteering on a ambulance in a foreign country; we picked up a call of a motorcycle accident. There was a 19 year old girl who got hit while on a motor bike with her boyfriend. I was sitting in the back with her taking her vitals; and even though i didn't really speak the same language as her she managed to communicate to me that she was scared and she wanted to hold my hand for comfort. I could not refuse; as she looked so scared and hurt. I felt compassionate towards her and wanted to comfort her best i could as a first aid provider. All i could tell her was that its going to be ok and that no her mother wont kill her for being on a bike with her boyfriend.,When I was watching Armagedon with my girlfriend and after having seen the movie about a dozen times; she still bawls like a baby at the final scene.

Of course; she came to me and told me what happened. She figured I would be there for her because she was one of my closest friends. I truthfully didn't know what to tell her at the time. I did not feel bad that she got caught because it was what she deserved. She was aware of the consequences but went ahead and cheated anyway. Therefore; in this particular situation I felt pity towards her. Although I did not agree with what she did; I told her that everything will be okay and she should try and fix her mistake by writing an apology note to her professor and the department. Ultimately; this is what she did.,,The most recent time I felt compassion was when I visited my little sister in the hospital. She was diagnosed with bronchitis and was admitted immediately. She is very dear to my heart so this was a really sad moment for me. I wanted to be there for her and make her feel like she was in a safe place; considering she was 2 years old. I brought her toys from home and read books to her while she laid in bed. I comforted her and made sure she was happy until she was finally discharged.,The most recent time I felt sympathy for someone was when my roommates grandfather passed away a couple weeks ago. I received the news the day of his passing. I decided to give her the space she needed and called the next day. I was very sad and devastated for her loss. Initially; I was at a loss for words but I pulled it together and began telling her that he is in a better place and looking down upon his family. I also told her that at one point; everyone will have to go and she should be happy he was here to stand by all of her accomplishments so far. I ended the conversation but telling her that if her or her family needed anything to let me know.,The most recent time I felt empathy towards someone was about two days ago. My cousin called me; frustrated to say the least;to talk to me about a phone call she had just had with one of her closest friends. They have been on and off; I guess you could say; but neither one of them had ever openly admitted their feelings for one another. When I answered the phone; it was clear she was upset because they got into an argument over some issues that had evolved. I began telling her that every relationship has problems and no relationship is perfect. I continued by telling her to not feel so upset over this and to work it out with him. I began thinking about the same situation I had been in a few months back so I knew exactly how she felt. I informed her about how I was in her shoes once and the one thing I learned from my experience was to open up about the issue the moment it happens; instead of bottling it all up inside which usually leads to arguments like the one she just had. I also told her to give him some space for the time being so they can both breathe and come back to the situation. She essentially took my advice and ended up working it out with him. ,2,0,1,2,1,3,,,1,,,1,1,7,1,4,3,4,1,1,2,6,1,2,7,4,5,7,7,1,1,5,4,5,3,2,3,7,5,2,1,3,4,1.

4/3/14 10:31,4/3/14 11:13,1000,0,0,0,0,0,0,One of my best friends in high school wanted to apply for a famous university when we graduated. But his father did not have enough confidence in him and persuaded him to choose another one. He gave up and applied for the one that his father chose. We had a general university selection exam in China for all high school students. After the score came out; he found that his score was just enough to get into his dream school. But he did not have a chance since he already applied for the other one. I felt very pity for him because I knew how much it mean to him. I wanted to cheer him up but I knew it was impossible. Such a big decision could not be comforted by words but only time. ,My friend suffered a difficult period during a busy semester. He did not do well in a very important exam and a very important project. He broke his new laptop and had to pay a lot to get it repaired. In a word; his life came to a mess. /  / I was one of his best friend. He had helped me a lot and I really cared about him. I felt tenderness. I wanted to do something to comfort his heart. I planned some small trips to cheer him up and moved him attention from the terrible exam result to something else. I knew it would past but it would be a difficult time since he was always of top range in the class.,My teacher told us about the situation of some poor areas in Africa. She talked about the living of the children there. I was very shocked and felt compassion for those children. They were of the same age as I at that time. But they suffered so much. I thought that life was so unfair. I did not know what I could do as I was only a middle school student at that time. But I felt if there were any chances to help them; I would love to do. ,, I met a schoolmate who was searching for an internship offer two weeks ago. He was very worried and tied.

4/3/14 10:40,4/3/14 11:42,1001,0,0,0,0,0,0,"When you play varsity high school football; you end up seeing a lot of guys cry towards the end of the season.  This is because for most guys; it's the last time they will ever play football (in pads; under the lights; with refs; etc.).  I remember my senior year there was a football team playing us the last game of the regular season.  We had already made the playoffs and were undefeated coming into the game; but they just needed this one win in order to qualify for the playoffs.  It was simple; if they won; they got to keep playing football. If they lost; they were done for the rest of their lives.  The game was close but we ended up winning 56-49 in the last few seconds of the game.  I remember seeing the players at the end of the field on their hands and knees crying because they knew the sport was over for them.  It was in that moment I felt pity.  I felt as if I deserved to move on and keep playing football; but still felt horrible for ending their careers. They had put so much blood; sweat and tears into the sport and; in fact; almost beat us even though we were the heavy favorite.  Knowing what I had done had caused someone emotional pain like that caused me to feel a lot of pity.  After we shook hands with some of the players I wanted to run over to those guys crying on the field and help them up and tell them ""sorry"" and ""good game.""  I didn't end up doing it because I thought they'd be more mad at me for ending their career and not respond well to that action.  But; my pity tried to drive me to that action.  I instead went back over to my team and listened to our coaches thoughts on the game. But; the whole time I was focused on the emotional heartbreak they felt.  ",I remember feeling tenderness toward someone vividly when they were rejected from this University during our senior year of high school.  It was hard to feel sympathy or empathize with them when I felt they truly didn't deserve to be accepted here.  But; on the other hand; it had been a goal for her to attend this university and study here.  I remember feeling tender and bad for her when she found out she was rejected; but it didn't affect me emotionally the way it would if I believed she had deserved to get in.  I felt tenderness for her because I knew it was something she wanted very badly; but I was content with what had happened because I knew more worthy applicants had been accepted.  Though I agreed with the outcome of the situation; I still felt bad for her and expressed this verbally to her.  I told her that it was going to be alright and that she should keep trying to get in here.  I wanted to tell her that getting into Michigan doesn't define your success as a student and that acceptance here is very competitive.  I felt a state of dissonance while telling her this because although I wanted to make her feel better; I agreed with the decision they had made.  ,,In the last days of my senior year in high school; my best friend's mom died due to ovarian cancer.  She died on a Monday and it hit the school like a ton of bricks.  This was a woman that I had seen quite regularly; drove me to countless sports practices and was good friends with my mom.  She played an integral role in the community; but rather an even more integral role in her family.  When I found out she had passed my stomach dropped.  I felt sad; mad and even cried a little about it.  I couldn't even imagine losing my mom at such a young age.  It was in that moment that I felt sympathy for my friend because of his loss.  When I attempted to put myself in his shoes; I couldn't even imagine the emotional pain and distraught he was feeling.  I reached out to him immediately on the phone and made sure he was alright.  I gave him my condolences and said I was here for him no matter what. I felt that no one should lose a parent that early. I even pondered starting a charity or some sort of charitable fund for cancer in honor of his mom.  What caused me the most sympathy was how calm and collected he seemed to be through it all.  Just two days after her death; he showed up to school for the last day of high school.  It was astonishing to me the strength that he could portray when I know if that had happened to me; I would be a wreck.  Through his unfortunate circumstance and his ability to stay strong and collected through the emotional shock; I felt more sympathy for him than I ever had in my life. ,,1,0,2,2,1,2,,1,,1,,3,6,1,6,7,1,3,7,2,4,4,7,4,6,4,5,3,6,6,5,5,6,6,6,4,3,4,6,2,6,2,6,1.

When I'm using compassion I tend to use it towards people who are feeling down or in need of someone to help them out emotionally. My encounter with using compassion was in practice when my teammate was feeling down; because he felt that the coaches always addressed how he made mistakes and not the things he did that were good. I pulled him to the side and told him that he needed to not worry about what the coaches said or did because that's just how the game is. He should only worry about the next play and how perfect he would be one step at a time; because everyone makes mistakes. I was going through the same problem before so i felt i could address the problem as effective as i could in order for him to get the idea that he only can control the controllable; which is what i needed to learn.,,Empathy is understanding how someone else is feeling. trying to connect to someone and understand how they feel even if you did not go through those situations.,1,3,0,1,2,0,,,,,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1. mercy / 2.  / 3. ,I dont feel pity is love at all,,2,1,1,4,5,5,5,4,5,3,3,3,3,4,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,,7,1,7,1,6,2,7,4,6,7,7,5,1,7,1,7,5,3,3,3,6,,7,7,6,4,6,4,7,6,4,6,1.

4/3/14 10:34,4/3/14 11:43,1003,0,0,0,0,0,0,There is a competitive Bollywood dance team circuit that has recently formed at the collegiate level. A bunch of my friends have joined the team here at the university and worked all year long to have an amazing competition season. The goal at the end is to get a bid to go to the national competition; which is held in California. This team has worked countless amount of hours and has placed at every single one of their competitions this year; however; they did not receive a bid for nationals this year. I felt pity for the team because of their dedication; but since they are a newly formed team; the circuit has not had the chance to get to know their abilities and chose a team that is more widely known instead of them to compete in California this year. In this instance I told the members of the team to stay proud and happy of all their accomplishments; and that as long as they keep working hard; they can get their bid next year. ,Volunteering at the children's hospital over the summer allowed me to interact with a lot of young patients that were going through a tough time in their life. Many of the kids that I had the chance to spend time with had a disease they were dealing with; but since they were so young; none of them really understood why they were really in the hospital. There was one little boy that I was reading a story to one day that really touched my hear. He had leukemia and did not understand why he had to be in the hospital all the time. He just wanted to fit in at school and play with his friends. I felt tender for this child because he was so sweet as he got along with all the other children in the hospital very nicely and was very respectful to the staff and myself. However; it touched my heart to see that he could not leave the hospital to go home and see his siblings; or go to school and play with his friends. In this instance I made sure that he was always smiling and playing with myself or meeting a new friend every day to keep him occupied and happy. So he felt less homesick. ,,Coming to college was a hard change from high school. The caliber was much difficult; along with the many credit hours; it was hard to balance school work and social events. However; I had a group of friends that all studied together all the time; and still managed to have a day of fun within the week. Once our first chemistry test came around; most of my friends and I scored really well on the exam; however one of my friends did not. Even though she studied as much as we did and maybe even more; she did not get the score she wanted. In this instance I felt sympathetic towards her because I knew college exams and classes are difficult and she worked so hard to do well; but did not meet the standards she wanted. After the exam we studied more together; just us; and made sure we did not only study. We thought that since we only stressed ourselves out by working so hard; it could be the reason why she stressed so much on the test. Therefore; we went to the gym more and hung out with friends outside of studying. ,,1,2,1,0,1,0,,1,,1,,2,2,3,1,4,2,2,2,4,6,2,4,1,4,3,4,3,4,4,5,3,3,2,3,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,1. Sympathy / 2.

I felt tenderness toward this situation because I love my mom and I hate to see her sad. I remember her coming home and i expected to hear good news but instead it was the opposite. I wanted to cry when she told us but I knew that would make it worse. So instead I gave her a hug and told her she will  pass it next time.,A time I felt compassion toward someone was when my brother's phone broke. I felt compassion because I knew how much he loved his phone and I felt bad because I still had my phone but he didn't have his. When I found out that it had happened; I wanted to ask him if he was sad; but instead I told him that he can use my phone whenever he wanted.,A time when I felt sympathy toward someone was when my friend received a bad grade on her quiz. It was a quiz in her German class; and she had work very hard on it and I had even helped her study for it. I remember getting out of class and seeing  her in the hallway crying. I felt so bad for her because I knew exactly how she was feeling. When I saw her I wanted to just give her a big hug. I talked to her and told her that the experience should motivate her to do better on the next quiz; and that she just has to work harder next time.,,1,2,1,1,0,2,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,7,1,6,3,5,1,1,7,7,7,1,2,1,4,1,1,3,3,7,4,7,7,1,7,1,4,1,1,7,7,1. sadness / 2.  / 3. ,I would call tenderness a kind of love in which you share a bond with the person.,1,1,7,1,7,4,1,1,1,5,7,4,1,4,1,4,6,7,1,1,4,6,6,6,2,4,4,2,4,7,4,5,1.  / 2.  / 3. ,I would not call compassion a kind of love because people you do not love may receive your compassion.,1,1,7,1,7,4,4,1,1,5,5,5,1,2,1,4,1,1,4,3,4,4,7,4,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,7,1. sadness / 2.  / 3. ,I would not call sympathy a kind of love because someone can have sympathy for a person they do not love.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4/3/14 10:34,4/3/14 11:52,1005,0,0,0,0,0,0,During my freshmen year in college; my friend decided that it was a good idea to bring a water bottle full of hard liquor to go to a party. Later that night; I heard that the cops checked the water bottle and found the alcoholic content. He received an MIP. At this moment; I felt pity towards my friend. It was his fault; and he should not have brought that water bottle with him.,,One person that I have the strongest relationship in college is my roommate; Chuck. He was from California; and I was from Colorado. We met at a kayak club. I felt comfortable around him and so did he because we were both new to the institution; and we felt out of place. I think we understood each other. Over the next few weeks; we became very close friends; as it turned out that we had a lot in common. We were both premed; and we had many classes together. We helped each other; from schoolwork to other social matters. We became such good friends that we decided to be roommates the next year. I do admit that when we were living together; there were more arguments and disagreements between us than ever before. When hearing about my other friends going through roommate problems; I always compared it to the relationship between me and Chuck. Even though we weren't always totally agreeable; we still got along. At that moment; I knew that he would be a great friend for a long time. That is when I felt a great compassion towards Chuck. As it turns out; we are still roommates; and our friendship has never been stronger.,About two years ago; my cousin graduated high school and applied to several different colleges; all being very selective. One thing about my family is that we are all a little greedy and stubborn. We don't like to take mediocrity as an option. My cousin; wanting to go to one of the best colleges in South Korea; had only applied to the prestigious institutions. Unfortunately; he didn't get into any of them. Because he didn't have a safety net school; he wasn't able to go to college that year. It was a rough time for him. He went through depression; and all of us were very concerned about him. I understood what he was going through because I; also didn't get into my top choice college. I understood his pain and frustration. At this moment; I felt a great deal of sympathy towards him.,,1,1,0,2,0,2,,,1,1,,3,4,4,1,3,3,1,1,1,1,3,1,5,6,6,1,7,7,1,1,1,2,6,2,1,1,4,5,1,5,1,6,1. Deserving / 2. Angry / 3.

4/3/14 10:34,4/3/14 11:42,1006,0,0,0,0,0,0,An experience that I have related to pity is when I was doing a group project in one of my high school classes. There were four of us in the group and we were brainstorming solutions to a problem that we were presented with. As we were discussing solutions everybody was talking and getting to know each other. One of the group mates does not have a great reputation around school and is known as very arrogant; but also very naive. He provided us with a solution that everybody in our group knew was wrong but he was convinced it was correct. We did everything we could to convince him that it was not the correct solution but he did not give in. The more we tried to prove to him that he was on the wrong track; the more he became offended. Instead of creating a rebuttal that was based on fact; he started insulting myself and the other group mates personally. At this time I was frustrated and angry; but also felt a sense of pity towards him because he was embarrassing himself by becoming so offended by our logic.  , A time when I have experienced tenderness is when spending time with my girlfriend. I can remember multiple occasions where having here around and holding her and spending time with her makes you feel warm inside and wanted. Tenderness to me is a feeling that you never want to let go of and it is a feeling that for me is closely associated with love and is a component of love.,, Everybody knows that commercial when you're sitting on your couch and there is a dog on the screen. Not a healthy; vibrant dog but instead a run-down dog that has clearly been abused or abandoned. The SPCA commercials that beg for adoption and help for those dogs also get my sympathy. Mostly because I am not in a position in my life where I can actually help; but I feel so selfish if I change the channel. ,,1,2,1,0,1,0,,1,,1,,1,1,7,3,1,4,4,2,7,1,4,1,4,4,6,7,7,7,1,2,2,7,4,2,4,2,6,6,3,4,2,5,1.

4/3/14 10:34,4/3/14 12:19,1007,0,0,0,0,0,0,"A few weeks ago; me and my friends were at a party on the weekend.  One of our friends is very outgoing and laid back around us and strangers as well most of the time; but she gets very nervous and scared when having to initiate a conversation with any guys that she finds attractive.  It has been a big problem for her all year and many a times she feels jealous when the rest of us are flirted with and not her and it has given her real low self-esteem and a negative perception of her body image.  So it was a really big deal for all of us when; at this party; admittedly after a few drinks; she saw a basketball players that shes idolizes and has a huge crush on and actually went up and talked to him.  It was a huge leap for her and they actually stayed talking for close to an hour.  After they split for a little she was so pumped up and confident and we were so happy for her.  She even went right back up to him later that night and asked him to dance; and he said yes.  One of his friends then came over and told him they were leaving but before he walked away; my friend worked up the nerve and asked him for his number.  Once again; a huge leap for her.  He gave it to her and all was great.  We laughed and screamed about it all the way home that night and my friend was ecstatic that she had attained the boy of her dreams.  Her confidence was at an all time high.  So you can imagine how crushed and embarrassed she felt the next day; when she texted the number he gave her and got a text back saying; ""sorry; you have the wrong number.""  We all felt terrible for her and definitely alot of pity.  We all tried to explain it away with sup-par excuses; like ""he probably was just so blackout that he doesn't remember your name and so doesn't think its you texting him"" or ""his coaches probably bind him in his contracts that he cant just give out his personal number to girls because they could like stalk him""; but inside we all knew the truth and felt helpless.  ",I have three dogs and I love very much.  Usually; the love is happy and energetic and light hearted.  But once during a very bad thunderstorm when I was the only one home in my house; my dogs began to cry and become very nervous and frightened by the sound of the thunder.  I corralled them all onto a couch with me and shushed them and stroked them until the calmed down.  They along clung to me and eachother and the soothing sounds of rain and my own hushing created a very poignant mood and as I looked in the eyes of these beautiful and innocent animals that trusted me whole heartedly and found their ultimate comfort in my arms made me feel such strong tenderness for them.  ,In high school; I volunteered at a soup kitchen in NYC one Saturday morning with a few fellow classmates.  The people there were all homeless and at first it made me frightened and guarded because they appeared on the outside very drab and dirty and possibly unsettled in their mind.  Of course; I knew they were all normal people equal to me and after remind myself that it was easy to feel that way but my initial reaction was undeniable.  After about an hour of serving; we were allowed to go around and mingle with the people; ask them about their day; try to cheer them up.  I really never got the hang of it and never felt brave enough to sit down and really engage someone.  But then I saw my friend with an old slightly frightening looking man having a very animated conversation and I worked up the nerve to sit down and join.  This man was so alive and so passionate about life and always staying happy.  He had a very adventurous life and had ended up in his situation for not really one reason or anything he did; it was just his lifestyle and a bit of bad luck that brought him all the way down to this point of poverty.  Although he appeared very unnatural and clearly had a little something off about him; I realized it simply because he had lived more and in a much different way than me and I suddenly respected him so much and felt strong compassion for his life and wanting to help him maintain his happiness and know that we thought he was wonderful.  ,Very recently; my uncle died after a long battle with cancer.  He has an 18 year old son at Cornell and a 16 year old daughter.  They all loved eachother deeply and he was an excellent father and very wise man.  It is a huge loss to our whole family; but I especially feel sharp sympathy for his children.  Both of them have so much going on in their lives and are such good people.  They do not deserve to have their worlds shattered like this at such a young age with such great opportunities at their fingertips which probably now look meaningless and trivial compared to this death.   / ,,1,0,2,2,1,3,,,,1,,1,1,6,2,4,3,3,1,6,4,6,2,5,6,6,6,3,3,5,6,6,1,5,3,5,2,4,3,2,1,3,6,1. anger / 2. sympathy / 3. helplessness,Pity is not a kind of love because things that invoke pity are usually universally seen as deserving pity.  If someone gets cheated on; a stranger and their mother would both feel pity because a fellow human was harmed unrightfully; so its human nature to feel pity about it.  The mother will feel it stronger and with many other emotions accompanying it but that is because she is involved and indirectly effected by the situation; like shes one step back from having grandkids.  ,It can be.  If one cannot have any personal gain or loss from the other persons situation; then they can have pure pity without contempt.  But say a person gets an ego boost from the other persons pain because they were somehow involved but avoided being embarrassed because they were better in some way; or at least they think they are.  Then it can be more like contempt. /  / ,7,6,1,4,2,6,5,5,3,7,2,4,1,2,1,6,4,4,2,2,5,4,5,3,6,5,3,3,2,2,6,5,1. love / 2. happiness / 3. poignancy,Tenderness does go hand and hand with love.  it is about staring into someones eyes and not just feeling happy about being with them but feeling like you know so much of them that you are acutally looking at complete truth in their eyes.

4/9/14 9:57,4/9/14 10:54,1008,0,0,0,0,0,0,I feel pity for my friend who is in a horrible relationship that she won't get out of. I feel pity for her because she knows how bad of a relationship she is in; but does not have the strength to get out of it. It is pitiful to watch her boyfriend treat her badly and she is pitiful for not standing up for herself and doing something about it. I would describe my feeling as pity towards her because she had put herself in this situation and refuses to get herself out of it. ,"I time I felt tenderness toward someone was when my good friend from high school's father passed away the day after New Year's. I was very shaken by the event because her father suddenly passed away one morning at breakfast with her family. There were no warning signs; he simply died. I would say that I felt tenderness towards her because everytime I thought about the situation and what she was going through; it was almost as if my heart literally hurt or was ""tender"". I found out he had passed away the morning after it had happen and I could shake the feeling of sadness and tenderness all day. I wished that there was something that I could do to lessen the pain that she was experiencing; but there was really nothing I could do. That is another reason that I would say I felt a ""tenderness"" towards her. When someone is experiencing such a devasting loss there is really nothing that anyone can do for them besides think and feel for them. The thinking and feeling for them is a form of tenderness. ",I felt compassion when I observed an Occupational Therapist working with a patient who had overcome very many challenges after suffering a debilitating stroke. I felt compassion for the patient because she had to work extremely hard to gain function back in the right side of her body. I would say that I felt compassion for her because there wasn't anything that I could do to help her gain function; but I felt passionately about her strength and determination. I could feel how passionately she wanted to be herself again. ,I feel sympathy for my friend as he waits to hear back from medical schools. I feel sympathy for him because it is a feeling that I can relate to as I was in the same boat as him when I was waiting to hear back from Occupatoinal Therapy schools. Sympathy is when you can identify with what another person is feeling. The ability to understand another's feeling generally comes from being a similar situation to them. Since you can identify with the person; you can usually tap into those emotions that you once felt to help the person deal with the situation. I make sure to allow my friend to talk with me about the anxiety and stress he feels while waiting to hear back. I feel like allowing him to vent his emotions can alleviate some of the built up stress because while I was waiting to hear back from schools; talking about my feelings helped me. ,I felt empathy for another patient that I observed at an Occupational Therapy clinic because she had lost function in her wrist. I empathized with her because I had also sprained my wrist once and lost function in it. I felt empathy towards her because I understood what she was feeling and I wanted to motivate her to keep trying to gain function. I didn't want her to give up on her exercises because she wasn't seeing immediate results. The difference between empathy and sympathy is that the feeling of sympathy has an element of sadness to it. The feeling of empathy has some sadness to it; but that sadness is overpowered by knowing you can help. ,1,4,1,3,0,2,,,,,,1,1,5,1,3,5,3,1,1,1,5,1,5,7,3,2,7,7,1,7,2,6,3,3,1,1,7,7,1,1,1,4,1. disgust  / 2.  / 3. ,Pity is not a kind of love.,Yes; I do because you know that person can do something about the situation they are in; but they won't. ,1,1,7,1,1,5,1,1,7,1,7,6,1,1,1,7,1,1,1,1,7,1,7,7,1,5,1,2,1,7,1,7,1. sadness / 2. helplessness / 3. sorrow,Tenderness would be the kind of love that you feel for your close family and friends. ,5,1,7,1,3,3,1,1,7,3,4,3,1,1,1,5,1,1,1,1,7,1,7,5,4,3,4,2,4,7,1,7,1. hopefulness / 2. detemination / 3. passion,I would not call compassion a kind of love,1,1,7,1,3,3,1,1,4,7,5,7,1,2,1,4,2,2,4,5,5,7,7,7,2,5,1,7,1,2,4,6,1. sadness / 2. hopefulness / 3. ,I would not call sympathy a kind of love,4,1,4,1,6,2,6,1,1,5,3,7,1,1,1,5,1,1,1,2,5,4,7,5,5,6,6,6,5,4,5,7,1. hopefulness / 2. motivational / 3. ,I would not call empathy a kind of love
4/16/14 13:55,4/16/14 15:33,1010,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,Three years ago; a very good friend of mine was going through some family trouble and a run-in with the law. I told her that she could stay with my family and me if she needed to get away. She took me up on that offer and stayed with us for a few days. One of the days we were chatting on the bed and she let everything out. She was crying and trying to make sense of what was going on in her life. She felt like everything she knew and had was falling apart. I just listened to her and didn't say anything for a long time. After a while; she calmed down and just laid down; looking up at the ceiling. Then I started to talk to her about life. I told her that even though things were messy in her life; she still has options. Her options may be limited and sometimes difficult; but she can change her life and pursue her dreams. We stayed up late just chatting about general things; but I'd like to think that in some way I had helped.,A friend of mine is in the same class as me and we had just taken an exam. The exam was extremely difficult and when we got our exams back; she was clearly upset with the outcome. I did fairly well; but I felt bad that she did not. We had been studying almost everyday together for this exam; but to find out that she didn't do as well; I was sad to see her feeling down. I wanted to comfort. So; I told her we'll study a lot harder for the final and we'll do extremely well.  / Later that night; she texted me to tell me that a grader had miscalculated and shorted her two points. I told her that was great because her grade will go up. Even though I couldn't do anything to change her grade; I could be there to support her and cheer her up. ,A few months ago; a close friend of mine was going through some hardship (mainly with school) and I wanted to help her get through it. I remembered in my second year of college; I was having a hard time with school work and losing friendships. Although the situation was slightly different; I remember feeling very upset and frustrated; similar to my friend. I told her what was going on in my mind at the time and who was there to support me.  / I wanted to assure her that obstacles and difficult times pass. They aren't permanent fixtures in her life. Because of my past experiences; I was able to discern who was a friend and who pretended to be. Also; I was able to become a stronger person from the difficult times I was confronted with. We talked about what steps I took to making sure that I wouldn't repeat my mistakes and what I could in the future to avoid situations like that. ,1,0,1,2,1,0,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,7,1,1,7,1,1,7,7,7,1,1,6,1,7,4,3,4,4,7,1,7,1,1,7,3,3,3,1,1,7,1. love / 2. hope / 3. sensitiveness,Loving that person even if they are a total stranger.

4/16/14 13:57,4/16/14 17:01,1011,0,0,0,0,0,0,A girl I know was asking very detailed questions to a facebook group im in (it's the girlfriends of a certain frat's members; closed group) about a recent bonfire that some frat people attended. She basically had trust issues and wanted to know why her boyfriend didnt invite her; how he was acting; how long he stayed. I felt bad for her; and it seemed like questions I'd want to know if my boyfriend did that to me; but id be too embarrassed to ask those semi-publicy! You could tell the other girls when they replied were downplaying whatever situation there was; because you cold tell they felt bad for her too. She later commented confirming the trust issues; and people were supportive of her; but it was embarrassing for her a little bit; to me at least. I talked about it with my friend later and she agreed.,My boyfriend has panic attacks sometimes. He also is depressed in general; and somewhat paranoid. I am the same way. One time late at night we were both both panicky and sad. We both have our moments of suicidal ideation; and we are both very good at talking each other through our emotions like this. He had had a rough time recently with applying and getting rejected to grad schools; with one of his friends accidentally being killed; it was winter; and he was having problems finding enough money to stay in his fraternity; and finding health insurance to see a therapist. I was also having some issues; and it's usually him taking care of me; and i have to admit that I was used to it being this way. As we talked; he started crying; and having irregular breathing; so I walked him through breathing like we normally do for each other. Then he said he'd been thinking all day of killing himself; and knew he was going to in the future; probably soon. I'd been at work all day; not even thinking about his issues. I could tell that he'd never tell anyone else but me this; and I felt not pity; not only empathy; but the word must be tenderness. I could tell he was in a very vulnerable state; one he does not show to everyone; but felt comfortable letting me know; and trusting me with that information. I had to place my issues aside to deal only with his; even though it's honestly usually the other way around. I knew he didnt want to tell me. He had been trying so hard to live in teh adult world-- grad school; rent; etc for a few months and now I saw him crying and shaking and it was late.,I saw a panel of formerly incarcerated women this past weekend; and their stories extended beyond the bland story-line of drugs; arrest; family problems; recuperation. While these steps are all very important and do not get at all as much attention as they should; I could potentially see myself in their situations; and felt the weight of society crushing back against me; knowing if I ever was in their situation; no one would be there to help me; I would be alone. I would not have their spirit and determination to take care of their families while in prison. I would give up and die. They spoke so candidly; I knew what they were saying was honest. I knew I should spend more time advocating for prisoners; especially women; but I knew I could not; since the issue is too large for me to possibly tackle alone. ,My boyfriend's friend died in a tragic car accident; that happened of absolutely no one's fault. My boyfriend was shaken up by it and didn't talk about it for days; even though I know he needed to and wanted to work through it. I even tried bringing it up in the kindest way possible. I could tell he was down and quiet more often than usual. I didn't know the guy; but still felt sad for everyone involved. No one close to me has ever died so i cant understand exactly what he was going through. I jsut wanted to be there for him and could feel his lower energy. ,A recent vivid time was when one of my best friend's boyfriend broke up with her after 3 years. They'd been so good together; and were planning on sticking it through when he went to college (she had graduated 2 years before; and he was a senior in high school). They had the best sense of humor together and really seemed to appreciate each other. They had had some bumps in the road as they say; but nothing really major; he just kind of stopped showing her as much care as he used to. She could sense this change but only slightly. One day he finally did it. When she texted me about it; I was relaxing with my boyfriend and immediately felt so sad for her; and sad with her. I began to tear up. I wanted to explain to my boyfriend what had happened but I didn't go into detail; since he didnt know her and it felt like it was too personal to share; and that he wouldn't care enough about it like I did. His anticipated lack of caring made him unsuitable for me to tell. / The storyline of her boyfriend's withdrawl from her was something I had gone through in the past. We had similar experiences of doing nothing wrong; but being withdrawn from and ultimately left by a significant other. She couldn't see a future without him in it; and I had felt the same way before. It made it worse that she was 3 hours away; and I couldn't do anything about it; and I felt a little guilty for being hit with this news while I was over here enjoying my time with my boyfriend.; and guilty that I had a normal day ahead of me while she had a terrible day ahead of her.
